 a2ps converts files into PostScript for printing or viewing. It uses a
 nice default format, usually two pages on each physical page, borders
 surrounding pages, headers with useful information (page number, printing
 date, file name or supplied header), line numbering, symbol substitution
 as well as pretty printing for a wide range of programming languages.

 Historically, a2ps started as a text to PostScript converter, but thanks
 to powerful delegations it is able to let you use it for any kind of files,
 ie it can also digest manual pages, dvi files, texinfo, ....
 .
 Among the other most noticeable features of a2ps are:
  - various encodings (all the Latins and others),
  - various fonts (automatic font down loading),
  - various medias,
  - various printer interfaces,
  - various output styles,
  - various programming languages,
  - various helping applications,

Description: Client-Server Backup System (Server side)
 This is a client-server backup system offering several workstations a
 centralized backup to a special backup server. Backing up only one
 computer is easily possible, too. Any streaming device can be used
 for writing the data to it, usually this will be a tape
 device. Writing backups is normally done sequentially: The next
 writing to tape goes to the end of the previous write no matter where
 you have restored from in the meantime.
 .
  Features:
  - Authentication of the client is performed before it can take over control
  - Access restriction for the streamer device -> security
  - Client-side per-file compression -> reliability
  - Data stream is written to tape in pieces -> fast finding of files
  - Tape position logging for each file
  - Tape capacity is fully used
  - Full / incremental backups
  - Raw partitions can be backuped
  - Client and Server buffering for maximal throughput is done
 .
 Note: Tk is required if you want to use the graphical configuration
 tool instead of the text configuration tool.

Description: Archive file manipulation program.
 Afio manipulates groups of files, copying them within or between
 filesystems and an afio archive.
 .
 Afio archives are portable as they contain only ASCII-formatted header
 information. Afio makes cpio-format archives.  Afio deals somewhat
 gracefully with input data corruption.  Afio supports multi-volume
 archives during interactive operation.  Afio can make compressed
 archives that are much safer than compressed tar or cpio archives.
 .
 Afio is best used as an `archive engine' in a backup script.

 AfterStep is a window manager based on FVWM which attempts to emulate
 the NEXTSTEP look and feel, while retaining the configurability of its
 predecessor.  Note that this window manager makes extensive use of the
 color palette.  If you have only an 8-bit color display, it will run
 as packaged, but you may want to modify the configuration to use fewer
 colors.
 .
 AfterStep is a continuation of the BowMan window manager project, but
 the name was changed to reflect the desire that it do more than
 simply emulate and become a valuable window manager in its own right.

Description: Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver (Client)
 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a
 network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
 take a look at afbackup, tob, taper, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.

Description: Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver (Server)
 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a
 network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
 take a look at afbackup, tob, taper, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.
 .
 For a quick start read the README.server.debian in /usr/doc/amanda.
 .
 Explanation of suggested programs:
  - perl is needed for some non essential server utilities
  - awk and gnuplot are needed for plotting statistics of backups
  - to backup the tape server, you need to install the client too
  - /usr/bin/Mail from mailx is used by amcheck to mail info about which
    tape is needed next, etc

Description: a cron-like program that doesn't go by time
 Anacron (like `anac(h)ronistic') is a periodic command scheduler.  It
 executes commands at intervals specified in days.  Unlike cron, it
 does not assume that the system is running continuously.  It can
 therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and
 monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
 don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
 Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
 intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.
 .
 This package is pre-configured to execute the daily jobs of the Debian
 system. You should install this program if your system isn't powered on
 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of other Debian packages
 are executed each day.

Description: Versatile, high-performance HTTP server with added Perl support
 This version of Apache contains the mod_perl module statically linked.
 .
 The most popular server in the world, Apache features a modular
 design and supports dynamic selection of extension modules at runtime.
 Some of its strong points are its range of possible customization,
 dynamic adjustment of the number of server processes, and a whole
 range of available modules including many authentication mechanisms,
 server-parsed HTML, server-side includes, access control, CERN httpd
 metafiles emulation, proxy caching, etc.  Apache also supports multiple
 virtual homing.
 .
 Separate Debian packages are available for PHP3, Java Servlet support,
 Apache-SSL, and other common extensions.  More information is available
 at http://www.apache.org/.

Description: Arbitrary precision calculator (original name: calc)
 Calc is an arbitrary precision arithmetic system that uses a C-like
 language. Calc is useful as a calculator, an algorithm prototyper and as a
 mathematical research tool. More importantly, calc provides one with a
 machine independent means of computation. Calc comes with a rich set of
 builtin mathematical and programmatic functions.
 .
 Calc is built on top of the library libcalc that represents numeric values
 as fractions reduced to their lowest terms. This library can also be used
 to add arbitrary precision capabilities to your own programs and is
 available in the Debian package `apcalc-dev'.
 .
 The original name of this package is `calc', but it had to be changed to
 `apcalc' for Debian, because there's already another package called `calc'
 in Debian. Nevertheless, the binary and manpage installed by this package
 are still named `calc'.

Description: Library for arbitrary precision arithmetic
 This package contains the library libcalc.a and the necessary header files
 which provide routines to handle arbitrary precision arithmetic with
 integers, rational numbers, or complex numbers. There are also many numeric
 functions such as factorial and gcd, along with some transcendental
 functions such as sin and exp.
 .
 This library is also used by the commandline calculator `calc', which is
 provided in the Debian package `apcalc'.

 The daemon constantly gathers information from the UPS (battery load,
 Temperature, workload, etc.) and logs them to a file. It shuts down
 the system cleanly after a certain period of constant power failure or
 if the battery load falls below a certain level.

Description: Utilities for Advanced Power Management (APM) on laptops
 On laptop computers, the Advanced Power Management (APM) support
 provides access to battery status information and may help you to
 conserve battery power, depending on your laptop and the APM
 implementation.  The apmd program also lets you run arbitrary programs
 when APM events happen (for example, you can eject PCMCIA devices when
 you suspend, or change hard drive timeouts when you connect the battery).
 .
 This package contains apmd(8), a daemon for logging and acting on APM
 events, apm(1), a client that prints /proc/apm, xapm(1x), an X11 utility
 that displays a little graph, on_ac_power(1), a program for shell scripts
 to determine if wall power is connected, and tailf(1) which follows the
 growth of a log file without writing to disk.
 .
 The Debian default kernel does *not* contain APM support, because it causes
 problems on some computers.  So, you need to recompile your kernel
 and enable APM support during configuration; the corresponding questions
 are in the 'Character devices' section.

 "ash" is a POSIX compliant shell that is much smaller than "bash".

 It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it executes scripts
 somewhat faster than "bash"), or as the default shell either of root
 or of a second user with a userid of 0 (because it depends on fewer
 libraries, and is therefore less likely to be affected by an upgrade
 problem or a disk failure).  It is also useful for checking that a
 script uses only POSIX syntax.
 .
 "bash" is a better shell for most users, since it has some nice

 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of

 pipelined functional units. The production of such software for
 machines ranging from desktop workstations to embedded processors can

 automate much of this process. We concentrate our efforts on the
 widely used linear algebra kernels called the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS).

 macros to allow both easy insertions of LaTeX commands, and easy
 compilation, previewing, and printing of your TeX documents.
 .
 AUC TeX also lets you browse through compiling errors TeX reports,
 while it moves the cursor directly to the reported error and displays
 documentation for that particular error.  This will even work when the
 document is spread over several files.
 .
 Currently XEmacs ships with its own AUC TeX, so this package should only
 be used with GNU/Emacs.  (I.e. you don't need to install this package if

 things that can be described by a set of attributes, without referring
 to other things.  The data values corresponding to each attribute are
 limited to be either numbers or the elements of a fixed set of

 autoproject interviews the user, then creates a source package for a

 package uses autoconf to configure itself, and automake to create the

 .
 The idea is that you execute autoproject just once when you start a
 new project.  It will ask a few questions, then create a new directory
 and populate it with standard files, customized for the new project.
 .
 Optionally, the new package will use a command line parser generator.
 Currently, autoproject supports two parser generators: clig by Harald
 Kirsch <kir@iitb.fhg.de> (see http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/software/), and
 autogen by Bruce Korb <korbb@datadesign.com> (see

Description: Linux AWE32 driver source and utilities
 Linux can now support the Sound Blaster 32, and Sound Blaster AWE32, through
 the use of a driver written by Takashi Iwai <iwai@dragon.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp>.
 These utilities are the package of AWE32 utilities for use with this driver,
 which manipulate patch files. They are required to load the vital '.SBK', or
 '.SF2' files, which will have been installed with your AWE32 DOS or Win95
 software in \SB16\SFBANK or \Windows\System. This also includes 'gusload',
 for loading GUS-format patches to the AWE32 driver.
 .
 This package installs the source for the AWE32 driver into /usr/src/awedrv.
 In order to use the awe32 driver, you must recompile your kernel, after using
 the install script found in this package to patch these sources into your
 kernel source tree (they can alternatively be manually installed into the
 kernel source or into a separate copy of the sound driver).
 .
 There are also some converters between different patch file formats for the
 AWE32, and the 'sfxtest' program for testing the AWE32 driver, which are
 installed in /usr/lib/awe.

 This is a program which will play MIDI files, either using a built-in
 tk-based interface, or from the console (in 'dumb' mode). It can also be
 used in 'pipe' mode, so that another program can control the playback. This
 makes a very flexible interface for adding AWE32 MIDI support to a program,
 or for writing your own front end for this program.

 beav is an editor for binary files containing arbitrary

 files they edit to contain textual data, and/or to be
 formatted in a certain way (e.g. lines of printable
 characters delimited by newline characters).
 .
 With beav, you can edit a file in HEX, ASCII, EBCDIC,
 OCTAL, DECIMAL, and BINARY. You can display but not edit
 data in FLOAT mode. You can search or search and replace
 in any of these modes. Data can be displayed in BYTE,
 WORD, or DOUBLE WORD formats. While displaying WORDS
 or DOUBLE WORDS the data can be displayed in INTEL's or
 MOTOROLA's byte ordering. Data of any length can be
 inserted at any point in the file. The source of this
 data can be the keyboard, another buffer, or a file.
 Any data that is being displayed can be sent to a printer
 in the displayed format. Files that are bigger than
 memory can be handled.

 bibindex converts a .bib file to a .bix file, which is a compact
 binary representation of the .bib file containing hash tables for
 fast lookup, as well as byte offset positions into the corresponding .bib
 file.
 .
 biblook provides an interactive lookup facility using the .bix and .bib
 files.  It verifies that the file version number and bibindex version
 number match its own values, and also compares the file time stamps
 so that it can detect whether the .bix file is out-of-date with
 respect to the .bib file.  In either case, execution terminates.
 .
 This Debian package features a command line history mechanism through
 the GNU readline library (an item listed in the upstream ToDo list).

Description: King James Version of the Bible: user interface program.
 This package contains a text-retrieval program and user interface which is
 primarily designed to operate on the text and concordance of the King
 James translation of the Bible, although it could, in principle, be
 used for any text.  The search/browse engine allows searching and
 reading passages from scripture. Includes full concordance.

Description: X11 Bibliography database tool
 bibview is a tool to let you set up and maintain BibTeX bibliography
 databases.  LaTeX can then use these automatically in citations and
 bibliographies in your documents.
 .
 From its README:
 .
    It [bibview] supports the user in making new entries,
    searching for entries and moving entries from one BiB to another.
    It is possible to work with more than one BiB simultaneously.
    bibview is implemented with Xt and Athena Widgets.
    There are six types of windows in bibview:
    The main window contains menus for customizing bibview and
    for working with BiBs on the file level.
    The bibliography window (one for every open BiB) contains commands
    for manipulating the BiB.
    The list window (at most one for every open BiB) shows a list of
    entries. It displays the fields author, title, type and year.
    The card window (at most one for every entry) helps editing an entry.
    It contains boxes for each field of the entry (according to the type).
    The fields can be edited by putting the mouse cursor into the field.
    Macros in fields and the symbol for concatenation ('#') are marked
    with a preceding '@'.

 connections, and forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate
 processes.) Preliminary tests show boa is capable of handling several

Description: Bootstrap-only compiler kit for a subset of Java(tm)
 BOCK is a prototype native compiler, originally intended to enable
 a Java(tm) development environment to be bootstrapped from a C-only
 environment.  It was envisioned that its sole purpose in life would be
 to compile the forthcoming "Jackal" Java compiler.
 .
 BOCK has, since then, gained functionality, and should soon be able
 to compile most non-graphical Java programs.  Its lack of anything
 resembling error checking means that it won't be of much use for
 development, but it might be able to generate a reasonably fast binary
 version of your program.
 .
 That said, BOCK is still very much in the pre-alpha testing stage.
 It is therefore unlikely to be of use to anyone except dedicated hackers
 and developers.
 .
 Also included is "jcomp", a slightly more friendly front-end for bock,
 which compiles programs against the BOCK mini-library and compiles
 BOCK's C output to native code in one step.

 The 2.0.X Linux Kernels support Bridging. This modules contains
 documentation and a tool to configure bridging.
 Any protocol can be bridged not only protocols that are supported by the
 Kernel. Bridging is very efficient by determining which Ethernet MAC
 addresses are on which side of the Bridge and forwarding only packets
 that are necessary. Linux will work like an Ethernet Switch!
 .
 You should have at least Linux 2.0.22 installed with bridging enabled
 for this to work. Earlier kernels have a memory leak.

Description: User daemon that tracks URL's looked at and logs them.
 Browser-history came from the will to overcome a Netscape bug: there
 is no global history, and if you close a window, its whole history is
 lost. For people browsing lots of sites, having the possibility of
 backtracking to where one has been before means that you dont have to
 put everything in your bookmarks file. If you are not sure if a site
 may be worth remembering, don't add it in your bookmarks. If you need
 it later, just browse your history files.
 .
 It works with: Netscape Navigator, Mozilla, and Arena.  Support for
 `browser-history' can easily be added to other browsers, provided you
 can program and have the browser sources.
 .
 A manual page and simple documentation will be installed in
 "/usr/doc/browser-history/browser- history.html", along with a simple
 CGI interface to grep the history log and display the result.  The
 optional CGI program requires `cgiwrap' or Apache configured with
 `suexec'.

 bsmtp is an alternative to rmail.
 .
 Special features of this bsmtp package:
  - Completely written in C.
  - Configurable batch size (automatically sends batch to uux when a

  - Creates backups of all outgoing batches (and removes them regularly)
  - Works with sendmail and postfix.

 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever

 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.

 rogue (rogue tanks are black).   Destroying  a  player  on
 another  team  scores  a  win,  while  being  destroyed or
 destroying a teammate scores a loss.  Rogues have no team
 mates  (not even other rogues), so they cannot shoot team
 mates and they do not have a team score.
 .
 There are two main styles of play:   capture-the-flag  and
 free-for-all.   In  capture-the-flag,  each  team  (except
 rogues) has a team base and each team with  at  least  one
 player has a team flag.  The object is to capture an enemy
 team's flag by bringing it  to  your  team's  base.   This
 destroys  every player on the captured team, subtracts one
 from that team's score, and adds one to your team's score.
 In  free-for-all,  there  are no team flags or team bases.
 The object is simply to get as high a score as possible.

Description: A high-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).  If you need to extract old *.bz files,
 please also install the Debian package "bzip".

Description: Graham Stoney's mechanized man page generator
 C2man is an automatic documentation tool that extracts comments from C
 source code to generate functional interface documentation in the same
 format as sections 2 & 3 of the Unix Programmer's Manual. It requires
 minimal effort from the programmer by looking for comments in the
 usual places near the objects they document, rather than imposing a
 rigid function-comment syntax or requiring that the programmer learn
 and use a typesetting language.  Acceptable documentation can often be
 generated from existing code with no modifications.
 .
 conformance: supports both K&R and ISO/ANSI C coding styles
 .
 Features:
  * generates output in nroff -man, TeXinfo, LaTeX or
    HTML format
  * handles comments as part of the language grammar
  * automagically documents enum parameter & return
    values
  * handles C (/* */) and C++ (//) style comments
 Problems:
  * doesn't handle C++ grammar (yet)

Description: Tool for configuring and maintaining network machines
 The main purpose of cfengine is to allow the system administrator
 to create a single central file which will define how every host
 on a network should be configured.
 .
 cfengine is also useful as an interpreter for a general scripting
 language for ordinary users.  It is handy for tidying up junk files
 and for maintaining `watchdog' scripts to manage access rights and
 permissions on files when collaborating with other users.
 .
 It takes a while to set up cfengine for a network (especially an
 already existing network), but once that is done you will wonder
 how you ever lived without it!

Description: It sets your computer's clock from time servers on the Net.

 system's offset relative to other systems, and adjusts the system
 time accordingly.  For isolated systems, the user can periodically
 enter the correct time by hand (using `chronyc').  In either case,

 CirclePack is a C program for the creation,
 display, manipulation, and storage of circle packings using
 X-Windows. Computations may be done in either hyperbolic, euclidean, or
 spherical geometry, though the routines for the latter are not
 yet complete. For the theory behind the package, one must consult
 the research literature. One of the author's primary interests
 concerns the parallels between the developing theory of circle
 packings and the classical theory of analytic functions.

 which parses the command-line of a typical C-program and returns the
 result in a structure of type Cmdline. Besides parseCmdline(), the
 function
 .
      void usage(void)
 .
 is generated and will be called by the command-line parser if the
 command line contains obvious errors. One of the main reasons to use
 clig is the automatic generation of a usage()-function which is
 always up-to- date with respect to the options actually understood by
 the program. Additionally, clig creates a manual page.  For more

Description: a Common Lisp implementation
 CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe
 University and Michael Stoll of Munich University, both in Germany.
 It mostly supports the Lisp described in "Common LISP: The Language
 (2nd edition)" and the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  It runs on
 microcomputers (DOS, OS/2, Windows NT, Windows 95, Amiga 500-4000,
 Acorn RISC PC) as well as on Unix workstations (Linux, SVR4, Sun4,
 DEC Alpha OSF, HP-UX, NeXTstep, SGI, AIX, Sun3 and others) and needs
 only 2 MB of RAM.  It is free software and may be distributed under the
 terms of GNU GPL.  The user interface comes in German, English, French
 and Spanish. CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a large subset
 of CLOS, a foreign language interface and a socket interface.  An X11
 interface is available through CLX and Garnet.

Description: A program specializer for C
 A program specializer or, as it is also called, a "partial
 evaluator" takes the source code for a program or a routine
 and (commonly) some of its input, and tries to produce faster but
 equivalent code, utilizing the fact that some of the variables
 will have known values so that some of the program's actions can
 be precomputed.
 .
 This allows one to combine the maintainability of a generic parameterized
 source code with the speed of programs optimized for specific problem
 instances.
 .
 C-Mix is a program specializer that works on portable C code. You will
 need a C compiler for compiling intermediate programs.
 For advanced use you may also want a WWW browser for browsing the analysis
 results.

 This is a lisp core that is loaded into memory by the

 .
 Having the small options means that this image will do less
 typechecking, like the fast core. Note that this doesn't
 mean it will crash at random, it just means that it only
 does the checks it _has_ to do, and that the error messages
 sometimes are not so clear.
 .
 Also to reduce the memory use it will bytecompile some
 less-often used parts. The value of this in the late 1990's
 with cheap memory is debatable.

Description: A Perl replacement for Make
 Excerpted from the README file:
 .
 Cons is a system for constructing, primarily, software, but is quite
 different from previous software construction systems. Cons was
 designed from the ground up to deal easily with the construction of
 software spread over multiple source directories. Cons makes it easy
 to create build scripts that are simple, understandable and
 maintainable. Cons ensures that complex software is easily and
 accurately reproducible.
 .
 Cons uses a number of techniques to accomplish all of this.
 Construction scripts are just Perl scripts, making them both easy to
 comprehend and very flexible. Global scoping of variables is replaced
 with an import/export mechanism for sharing information between
 scripts, significantly improving the readability and maintainability
 of each script. Construction environments are introduced: these are
 Perl objects that capture the information required for controlling the
 build process. Multiple environments are used when different semantics
 are required for generating products in the build tree. Cons
 implements automatic dependency analysis and uses this to globally
 sequence the entire build. Variant builds are easily produced from a
 single source tree. Intelligent build subsetting is possible, when
 working on localized changes. Overrides can be setup to easily
 override build instructions without modifying any scripts. MD5
 cryptographic signatures are associated with derived files, and are
 used to accurately determine whether a given file needs to be rebuilt.

Description: management of regular background processing
 cron is a background process (`daemon') that runs programs at regular
 intervals (for example, every minute, day, week or month); which
 processes are run and at what times are specified in the `crontab'.
 .
 Users may also install crontabs so that processes are run on
 their behalf, though this feature can be disabled or restricted to
 particular users.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do various standard
 system maintenance tasks, such as ensuring that logfiles do not
 grow endlessly and overflow the disk.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor
 way that dselect handles "Recomments", but I do strongly suggest that
 you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.

Description: Logfile rotator for web servers
 A simple program that reads log messages from its input and writes
 them to a set of output files, the names of which are constructed
 using template and the current date and time.  The template uses the
 same format specifiers as the Unix date command (which are the same
 as the standard C strftime library function).
 .
 It intended to be used in conjunction with a Web server, such as
 Apache, to split the access log into daily or monthly logs:
 .
   TransferLog "|/usr/sbin/cronolog /var/log/apache/%Y/access.%Y.%m.%d.log"
 .
 A cronosplit script is also included, to convert existing
 traditionally-rotated logs into this rotation format.

 changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.  Unlike the simpler systems,
 CVS does not just operate on one file at a time or one directory at
 a time, but operates on hierarchical collections of directories
 consisting of version controlled files.
 .
 CVS helps to manage releases and to control the concurrent editing of
 source files among multiple authors.  CVS allows triggers to
 enable/log/control various operations and works well over a wide area
 network.

 file, and imports it into CVS. The module path can maintains
 distribution and section information; for example, one may inject
 hemm/hemm/devel/make into the repository.
 .
 The build process works analogously to dpkg-buildpackage, and can be
 used from within the checked out source tree, or with additional
 information, can be used from anywhere. In the latter case, you can
 build any previous version of the package, as long as the
 corresponding orig.tar.gz file is still around. The build script
 checks out the relevant version from the CVS repository, and runs
 dpkg-buildpackage to create the Debian package.
 .
 Combined, these utilities provide an infrastructure to facilitate the
 use of CVS by Debian maintainers. This allows one to keep separate
 CVS branches of a package for stable, unstable, and possibly
 experimental distributions, along with the other benefits of a
 version control system.
 .
 This can be used to generate a unified CVS source tree, for example.

 CWEB allows you to write documents which can be used simultaneously as

 The philosophy behind CWEB is that programmers who want to provide the best
 possible documentation for their programs need two things simultaneously: a
 language like TeX for formatting, and a language like C for programming.
 Neither type of language can provide the best documentation by itself.  But
 when both are appropriately combined, we obtain a system that is much more
 useful than either language separately.

Description: Daemon that transfers files via FTP/HTTP in the background.
 Darxite is an system for retrieving files via FTP and HTTP where
 a "daemon" process sits in the background and transfers files,
 while a number of "client" processes can control it and provide a
 user interface. The client programs available include a nice GTK
 FTP client, a GNOME Panel applet and a command-line FTP client.
 .
 Highlights include:
        * If a transfer gets too slow, the system can switch to a
          mirror site automagically.
        * Transfers can be spooled, so you know from looking at the
          file when they have completed.
        * The daemon can be controlled remotely, thus enabling a
          faster computer to be used as a sort-of FTP proxy or file
          server, etc.
        * Programs can be set to automatically execute when transfer
          is complete.
        * Support for FTP and HTTP, and HTTP proxies.
        * Recursive FTP download/uploads.

 As a file system is used, data tends to become more and more scattered

 reorganises the data on the disk, so that individual files occupy a
 single sequential set of disk blocks, and all the free space on the
 disk is collected together in a single region.  This generally means
 that reading a whole file is more efficient.

Description: Alternative Debian package manager
 dftp is another program to maintain your Debian installation. It
 downloads the lists of currently available packages via FTP, compares
 them to the installed packages and lets you interactively select
 which new/upgraded packages you want to install. Dependencies of new
 packages are checked and missing packages offered for installing,
 too. Then all selected packages are fetched with FTP and verified for
 correctness. Installation of packages is done via dpkg, and ordered
 by dependencies.
 .
 dftp's main advantage over other interfaces to Debian package
 management is that it can (partially) run on a different machine than
 the target system, if that doesn't have direct FTP access. Scanning
 the current installation and installing packages must of course be
 done on the target system. But package selection and download can be
 moved to a different machine. dftp can also run on non-Debian
 systems. Therefore it is also available as a standalone version (Perl
 script) in /debian/project/misc.

Description: dial on demand daemon for PPP and SLIP.
 Many sites use SLIP or PPP links to connect to other sites over phone
 lines. Normally these links must be explicitly turned on or off.
 diald can be used to bring a SLIP or PPP link up when there are
 Internet packets to be sent to another site, and to close the link
 down when it is idle.
 .
 diald operates by starting a SLIP link on a pseudo tty and setting up
 a route to the resulting interface. This interface is called the
 proxy.  diald monitors the proxy to determine when to bring up a real
 communications link.  When a real link is up diald routes packets from
 the proxy to the real link and monitors the real link to decide if it
 needs to be shut down.  As well, if the link goes down unexpectedly
 diald will attempt to reestablish the link.  The rules for controlling
 these operations are extensively configurable in run time startup
 files.
 .
 For diald to work the kernel *must* have SLIP devices, either compiled in
 or as a module, even if only PPP connections are made. In the latter case
 you should also have pppd, of course.
 .
 Diald needs a program like "chat" or "expect" to actually dial.
 Sorry, "dip" cannot be used.

 Either dict-web1913 or dict-wn is essential for a useful
 dictionary server.  It is strongly recommended that both be installed.
 It is desirable that either dict-jargon or dict-foldoc, or both of
 them, be installed.
 .
 The client program, dict, is packaged in dict*.deb  If you are
 running a server, you will want the client for all machines in your
 network, and for testing server operations.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diff package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 from a read-only NFS mount on every boot. If you suspect somebody
 has cracked into your NFS-root host, rebooting it will restore it back to
 its original state. However, this makes it slower to boot then the
 diskless-image-simple.

 the end-user receiving your source code will simply have to read
 your README file, run the Configure script (which is self-documented),
 and then run make.
 .
 The second component is the Makefile.SH generator, which is a generic
 configured Makefile, reusing some of the information figured out
 by Configure, and a generic Jmakefile description.
 .
 The third component is the RCS aware package generator, which is
 used when it's time to build up the shell archives used to distribute
 your program.
 .
 The fourth and latest component is the patch generator, used to
 make updates of your sources, which can later be applied on the original
 distribution by using the patch program.

Description: Checks dns zone information using nameserver lookups
 This program analyzes any DNS zone you specify, and reports any problems it
 finds by displaying errors and warnings.  Then it descends recursively to
 examine all zones below the given one (this can be disabled with a command-

 .
 You don't have to feed any BIND conffiles to Dlint. Dlint uses
 nameserver calls to gather information.
 .
 Designed for Unix, dlint is written in Bourne Shell and Perl.
 .
 You may try it online at http://www.domtools.com/dlint/
 (this server imposes a timeout period; to lint a big zone, you should
 install dlint yourself and use it locally - that's what this package is for).

 translates information from checkboxes, entries, menus etc. to some sort
 of code (eg. Lisp, C, the configuration language for the fvwm window
 manager, or any other textual code). This transformation is coded in
 modules, where the programmer tells which elements are to be shown (a
 checkbutton, listbox, etc.) and gives some help on each element.
 .
 With this release, modules exist for configuring bash, fvwm1, fvwm2,
 tcsh, elm, rtin, ipfwadm and procmail, and they can be found in

 DSSSL standard regarding specification files, composing a specification
 body from one or more files conforming to the DSSSL architectural
 form, then mapping from the specification body (i.e. sequences of
 expression language forms) to a reordered normalised form thereof and
 loading the result into a Scheme interpreter with access to a document
 source grove.
 .
 Comprehensive and detailed error messages, based on a large database
 of information about the calling sequences for all specification
 language functions and forms are logged to stderr, together with
 (optionally) information about feature usage.

 german credit institutes in order to transfer commands for money
 exchanges between accounts.  This format is used both between banks
 and between banks and their customers.  One mainly wants to use it to
 be able to do automatic "Bankeinzuege".
 .
 This package probably will only be useful in Germany.

Description: The headers and static libraries for ext2fs-aware tools-development.
 EXT2FS stands for "Extended Filesystem", version 2. It's the filesystem
 type used for hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
 .
 This package contains the headers and shared libraries needed to compile
 ext2fs-aware programs. Only programmers that really manipulate
 features specific to the ext2 filesystem will need this. Most
 programmers will use the generic filesystem-independent interface
 from libc.
 .
 It also contains dev files for the e2p lib used by
 the e2fsprogs, but which is not yet packaged all by itself
 because it lacks documentation. It may also lack some support
 files, by I can't really know until someone uses it...
 .
 libe2p is for user-level e2fsprogs commands.  It's used by dumpe2fs,
 chattr, and lsattr.  Functions in libe2p typically have two
 characteristics (a) don't require that block device containing the
 filesystem be opened directly (functions in libext2fs do), and (b)
 libe2p typically contains printf statements or parse user input, and so
 have more internationalization issues.

 efax is a small ANSI C/POSIX program that provides the data transport
 function for fax applications using any Class 1 or Class 2 fax modem.
 Another program, efix, converts between fax, text, bit-map and gray-scale
 formats. fax, a shell script, provides a simple user interface to the efax
 and efix programs. It allows you to send text or Postscript files as faxes
 and receive, print or preview received faxes.
 .
 The ghostscript package is needed to fax Postscript files, and a image
 viewing program as xloadimage is need to view incoming faxes.
 .
 Note that you probably have to adapt /etc/efax.rc to your needs.

 and multipart/* messages -- only needs to use metamail
 with a content-type that Elm doesn't understand, access
 to individual portions of MIME multipart message via
 a special menu, "[include" construct when editing message
 as well as a new easy-to-use "Attachments" menu that lets
 you add/modify/delete attachments, mime.types support.
 .
 Elm's interface is interactive, full-screen.  All configuration
 can be done within the program -- no need to edit external files.
 .
 This version of Elm ME+ is officially designated
 "Elm2.4ME+ PL66 (25)" meaning this enhanced version of
 Elm is based upon Elm2.4pl25.  Thus is has all features

Description: speech output interface to Emacs
 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.  (Until now, the only
 option available to visually impaired users has been to use a talking
 PC as a terminal.)  Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs.  Once you
 start emacs with emacspeak loaded, you get spoken feedback for
 everything you do.  Your mileage will vary depending on how well you
 can use Emacs.  There is nothing that you cannot do inside Emacs :-).
 This package includes speech servers written in tcl to support the
 DECtalk Express and DECtalk MultiVoice speech synthesizers.  For
 other synthesizers, look for separate speech server packages such as
 emacspeak-ss.

Description: The Enlightenment Window Manager
 Enlightenment - the window manager that dares to do what others don't.
 It features KDE and GNOME integration, multi-program sound support,
 iconification, sliding desktops, docking, epplets, and much more.
 Enlightenment takes the concepts of themes to another level - everything
 can be changed. The visual components of themes are a rich set of graphical
 images in a variety of formats. Theme makers can unleash their artistic
 talents without bounds. Themes are not limited to just different colors
 and background images on the same old desktop.
 .
 Enlightenment features the BrushedMetal theme, designed by gimp legend,
 tigert. It is predominately grey with the subtle texture of - you guessed
 it - brushed metal.  The menus in particular look superb. The sound files
 for BrushedMetal are in a separate package, enlightenment-theme-brushedmetal.

Description: Modified ircII client with additional functionality
 EPIC is 100% backwards compatible with ircII because EPIC *is* ircII.
 EPIC was originally built upon the ircII-2.6 client and has maintained
 faithfulness to remain current up to the 2.8.2 release.
 EPIC is somewhat larger than the stock client (24%), but that is mostly
 because of the multitude of new features, the dual ANSI/K&R compliant
 function headers, and the large amount of re-written code in an attempt
 to make ircii faster, more efficient, and more powerful.

 Previous versions of epic were 100% compatible with ircII 2.8.2, though
 this is no longer the case.  Instead we've taken a new direction and chosen
 to find places where compatibility with ircII is undesirable and fix them.
 No gratuitous incompatibilities have been added, though many new features
 have been.

Description: Circumventing Debian package dependencies
 This is a dummy package which can be used to create Debian
 packages, which only contain dependency information.
 .
 This way, you can make the Debian package management
 system believe that equivalents to packages on which other
 packages do depend on are actually installed.
 .
 Another possibility is creation of a meta package. When this
 package contains a dependency as "Depends: a, b, c", then
 installing this package will also select packages a, b and c.
 Instead of "Depends", you can also use "Recommends:" or
 "Suggests:" for less demanding dependency.
 .
 Please note that this is a crude hack and if thoughtlessly used
 might possibly do damage to your packaging system. And please
 note as well that using it is not the recommended way of dealing
 with broken dependencies. Better file a bug report instead.

 should be.  An interpreted language provides branching and high-
 level control structures to direct the dialogue.  In addition,
 the user can take control and interact directly when desired,
 afterward returning control to the script.  This version works

Description: Reincarnation of the classic ctags(1): facilitates source navigation
 ctags (or etags) parses source code and produces a sort of index
 mapping the names of significant entities (e.g. functions, classes,
 variables) to the location where that entity is defined.  This index
 is used by editors like vi and emacsen to allow moving to the
 definition of a user-specified entity.
 .
 This version of ctags is said to be better than others in that it has
 more robust parsing (i.e. more accurate) and recognises more
 languages and types of entity.
 .
 Groks C (both K&R and ANSI), C++, Java, Eiffel, Fortran.
 .
 Can generate tags for *all* types of language tags, including all of
 the following:
 .
        C/C++:
            macros, enumerators, function definitions, prototypes and declarations,
            class, enum, struct, and union names, class, struct, and union members

 Provides routines that can be plugged in to replace malloc(),

 the program cleanly -- this means you don't have to check the
 return values from malloc if you don't want to.
 .
 For debugging FDA provides a nice toolkit for validating pointers,
 checking for leaks, gathering memory statistics, bounds checking and
 other nice things.  FDA uses shredding, prefix and postfix signatures,
 and a liberal amount of predicate asserts.

 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.
 .
 This product includes software developed by the University of California,

Description: Fast Light Window Manager
 Flwm is an attempt to combine the best ideas from several
 window managers. The primary influence and code base is from
 wm2 by Chris Cannam. Primary features copied from wm2 are:
 .
  - Does not look like Windoze.
  - Nifty sideways titlebars.
  - No icons. You deiconize by picking off a pop-up menu.
    This means no space is wasted by icons.
  - Really small and fast code.
 .
 It is enhanced by the author's own further nutty ideas:
 .
  - Does not use shape extension, more standard resize handles.
  - Occupies as little screen space as possible. The border and titles
    are as thin as I could possibly make them. And maximized
    windows waste only 15 pixels horizontally and zero (count'em)
    pixels vertically!
  - Independent maximize buttons for width & height, close button.
  - Understands Motif, KDE, and Gnome window manager hints.
  - Multiple desktops, controlled from the same menu as the icons.

 in this update.
 .
 Contained is the source for 2 programs.  dlcicfg and fradcfg will read from
 a configuration file, and create the interfaces with parameters in the
 file.  Once the devices are created, the standard ifconfig can be used to
 assign IP addresses and otherwise configure the device.
 .
 These tools are an alternative to the "wanpipe" package.  The package
 might be simpler to configure since it contains only support for frame
 relay.

Description: a package for creating and reading constant databases
 freecdb is a small, fast and reliable utility set and subroutine
 library for creating and reading constant databases. The database
 structure is tuned for fast reading:
 .
  - Successful lookups take normally just two disk accesses.
  - Unsuccessful lookups take only one disk access.
  - Small disk space and memory size requirements; a database
    uses 2048 bytes for the header and 24 bytes per record.
  - Maximum database size is 4GB; individual record size is not
    otherwise limited.
  - Portable file format.
  - Fast creation of new databases.
  - No locking, updates are atomical.
 .
 This package contains both the utilities and the development
 files.

 .
         initial text (e.g. <caption> ... </caption>).
 .
         (X, Y) options for cell (X, Y)

 Rows and cells may be specified in any order, numbering starts at 1.
 X and/or Y may be replaced by a regular expression to indicate rows or
 columns.  Options or text (or both) may be omitted for cells.  Cells
 may be omitted completely if they are empty or fall under the

Description: Bundled tests, demos and tools for FreeType
 The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering engine.
 It has been developed to provide TT support to a great variety of platforms
 and environments.
 .
 Note that FreeType is a *library*. It is not a font server for your favorite
 platform, even though it was designed to be used in many of them. Note also
 that it is *not* a complete text-rendering library. Its purpose is simply to
 open and manage font files, as well as load, hint and render individual
 glyphs efficiently. You can also see it as a "TrueType driver" for a
 higher-level library, though rendering text with it is extremely easy, as
 demo-ed by the test programs.
 .
 This package contains several programs bundled with the FreeType engine for
 testing and demonstration purposes, as well as some contributed utilities
 such as ttf2pk, ttf2bdf, ttf2pfb and ttfbanner.

 FSP is an alternative to anonymous FTP.  In the words of the developers,
 `FSP is what anonymous FTP *should* be'.  FSP is a protocol, a bit like
 FTP, for moving files around.  It's designed for anonymous archives, and
 has protection against server and network overloading.  It doesn't use
 connections, so it can survive things falling over.  It's also designed to
 prevent network congestion, so it can be very nice for large transfers over
 slow links.

Description: Bleeding Edge floppy tape driver (utilities)
 A substitution for the stock ftape driver in the kernel. If you
 want to use a floppy tape drive with a 2.0.x kernel you should definitly
 use these sources instead of the stock ftape driver in the kernel.
 This driver detects and supports many more tape drives than the
 2.0.x driver which is ancient.
 Compared to the 2.2.x stock ftape driver the difference is
 reduced to support for the Iomega Ditto Max, parallel port floppy
 tapes (Colorado Trakker, Iomega, Exabyte and Seagate parallel port
 drives) and multiple tape drives in one box.
 .
 Supported drives according to upstream README:
 "Currently, the driver supports many QIC-40/QIC-80/QIC-3010/QIC-3020
 tape drives that conform to the respective QIC-* development
 standards, as well as the Iomega Ditto 2GB and Max drives.
 .
 Some parallel port tape drives are also supported, too. These are the
 Colorado Trakker and several kinds of parallel port drives that use
 the Micro Solutions' "Backpack" protocol, i.e. the Iomega Ditto
 parallel port drives, and some parallel port floppy tape drives made
 by Exabyte and Seagate."
 .
 If you want to use the graphical frontend you've got to install a version
 of the TK toolkit.

Description: A semantic checker for Fortran 77 programs.
 ftnchek (short for Fortran checker) is a tool designed to detect
 certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does not,
 thus assisting users in the debugging of their Fortran programs.
 .
 Unlike syntax errors, semantic errors are legal in the Fortran
 language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation. For
 example, variables which are never used may indicate some omission in
 the program; uninitialized variables contain garbage which may cause
 incorrect results to be calculated; and variables which are not
 declared may not have the intended type.
 .
 ftnchek can also be used to provide call-trees, cross-reference of
 subprogram calls and COMMON blocks usage, source listings, symbol
 tables and other things you might find useful when debugging a
 Fortran program.

Description: file mirroring utility
 ftpgrab is a utility for maintaining FTP mirrors. In fact not unlike the
 "Mirror" perl program. However ftpgrab is oriented towards the smaller
 site which doesn't have the resources to mirror entire version trees of
 software.
 .
 The primary "plus point" of ftpgrab is that it can base download decisions
 by parsing version numbers out of filenames. For example, ftpgrab will
 recognize that the file "linux-2.2.2.tar.gz" is newer than
 "linux-2.2.1.tar.gz" based on the version string. It will then download
 the new version and delete the old one when it is done, thus saving you
 mirroring 10 kernel versions all at >10Mb each.

 Gaby is a _small_ personal databases manager for Linux
 using GTK+ and Gnome (if available) for its GUI.
 .
 It was designed to provide straight-forward access to databases
 a 'normal' user would like (addresses, books, ...) while keeping
 the ability to easily create databases for other needs. On a
 technical side it was designed with extensibility in mind and
 thus use relies a lot on plug-ins.

Description: SQL database and parser generator in Python
 Gadfly is a relational database management system which uses a
 large subset of very standard SQL as its query language and Python
 modules and optional Python/C extension modules as its underlying
 engine.  Gadfly stores the active database in memory, with recovery
 logging to a file system. It supports an optional TCP/IP based
 client server mode and log based failure recovery for system or
 software failures (but not for disk failures).
 .
 kwParser, included as part of the Gadfly package, is a parser
 generator for Python.  It transforms an abstract specification of a
 language grammar (for example the CORBA Interface Definition Language)
 together with "interpretation functions" that define the semantics of
 the language into a compiler or translator or interpreter.

 on a mailbox will launch the configured command, generally a command
 to read the mailbox with your favorite mailreader. Pressing the right
 mouse button will bring up the configure menu.

Description: Prints calendars
 Gcal displays a calendar for a month or a year, eternal holiday lists
 and fixed date lists, in many ways. The program correctly omits the
 dates that were skipped when the current Gregorian calendar replaced
 the earlier Julian calendar.
 .
 Apart from the usual and well known calendar functions like the
 output of a month or a year calendar sheet, or the output of an eternal
 holiday list, Gcal offers the facility to display fixed dates on the
 day of their occurrence and to remind or inform the user about them.
 So it's imaginable after booting the computer or starting the work
 session, that the user is informed on screen or by means of electronic
 mail, about all holidays or appointments which are observed or
 scheduled for that day.

 The game is played with YOU at the bottom of the screen.  At the
 top is a random assortment of colored shapes ("gems").  As time
 goes on, more gems appear at the very top of the screen, pushing the
 rest downwards.  The game is over when the gems reach the bottom.
 .
 It's your job to keep the screen from filling up.  You do this by
 "grabbing" gems from the top of the screen, carrying them around,
 if need be, and "throwing" them back up.
 .
 If, when you throw some gems back up, you create a "match" of 3 or more
 gems in a vertical column, they disappear (with a cool little explosion).
 At this point, if there are any "matches" of the same gem to the left or
 right of this column, they disappear too!  And so on.  This is great for
 cool chain-reactions! You also get more points for the more gems that
 disappear in a match.  (Matching four gives as many points as matching
 three twice, for example.)

 single neurons to simulations of large networks made up of more abstract
 neuronal components.
 .
 GENESIS has provided the basis for laboratory courses in neural simulation
 at both Caltech and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA.
 Most current GENESIS applications involve realistic simulations of
 biological neural systems.  Although the software can also model more
 abstract networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation

Description: Monitor UPS and handle line power failures
 The express aim of the genpower package is to add additional functionally
 and a simpler means of configuring UPS monitoring, in a full featured
 suite that can be configured to work with most UPSs featuring an RS232
 monitoring port.
 .
 Depending on the UPS, cable, and the manner in which the genpower
 package is configured, the genpower package provides the following
 features:
 .
  * Line power sensing
  * Low battery detection
  * Physical cable detection
  * The ability to kill the UPS's inverter
 .
 The Debian package has an extra cable description called "apc-pnp"
 that should support all of the above for the APC Back-UPS Pro, Smart-UPS,
 and Matrix-UPS systems using the included Windows-95 Plug-and-Play cable!

Description: A fully GUI configurable X file manager using GTK+
 gentoo is a file manager for X11, written from scratch in pure C. It
 utilises the GTK+ toolkit for its interface. A goal with gentoo is to let
 the user do all configuration from within the program itself; there should
 be no need to hand-edit configuration files and restart the program in
 order to customize it.
 .
 gentoo features a fairly complex and powerful file identification system,
 coupled to a object-oriented style system, which together give you a lot
 of control over how files of different types are displayed and acted upon.

Description: interactive geometry viewing program
 Geomview is interactive geometry software which is
 particularly appropriate for mathematics research and education.
 In particular, geomview can display things in hyperbolic and
 spherical space as well as Euclidean space.
 .
 Some modules which rely on the libforms library have been removed.
 .
 Geomview allows multiple independently controllable objects and
 cameras.  It provides interactive control for motion, appearances
 (including lighting, shading, and materials), picking on an
 object, edge or vertex level, snapshots in SGI image file or
 Renderman RIB format, and adding or deleting objects is provided
 through direct mouse manipulation, control panels, and keyboard
 shortcuts.  External programs can drive desired aspects of the
 viewer (such as continually loading changing geometry or
 controlling the motion of certain objects) while allowing
 interactive control of everything else.

 Forth, as a language, is best known for being stack-based, and completely
 extensible.  Each Forth environment provides one or more dictionaries of
 pre-defined words, and programming in Forth consists of defining and
 executing new words that are combinations of previously defined words.  It
 has been said that learning Forth changes forever the way you think about
 writing programs.

    o Shell command line (see 'Global')
    o nvi editor (see 'Extended nvi using global')
    o emacs editor (see 'Emacs using global')
    o Web browser (see 'Hypertext generator')
    o Elvis editor (see 'Elvis using global')
 .
 Supported languages are C/C++ Yacc and Java.
 You can locate a specified function in the source files and move
 there easily. It is especially useful for hacking large projects
 containing many subdirectories, many '#ifdef' and many main()
 functions, like X or kernel source.
 .
 GLOBAL consists of global(1), gtags(1), htags(1),
 an extended nvi(1), gtags.el and gozilla(1).
 .
 This package include the htmake(1) extension which allows GLOBAL's
 hypertext search function to be implemented from a single central
 cgi script.

Description: The OpenGL Utility Toolkit.
 GLUT (pronounced like the glut in gluttony) is the OpenGL Utility Toolkit,
 a window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs.  It
 implements a simple windowing application programming interface (API) for
 OpenGL. GLUT makes it considerably easier to learn about and explore OpenGL
 programming.
 .
 GLUT is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs.
 While GLUT is well-suited to learning OpenGL and developing simple OpenGL
 applications, GLUT is not a full-featured toolkit so large applications
 requiring sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window
 system toolkits like Motif. GLUT is simple, easy, and small.

 Gman is nothing else but only a simple front-end for the original man
 page system. The most basic job of gman is to build a database for all
 the man pages and display them (or part of them) on the screen. When
 user decides to read a man page, gman will launch a terminal window and
 call the original man system to display the man page in the window.
 .
 Gman can launch more than one terminal window at same time. And user can
 use the index search function to look for the man pages that he needs.
 It's simple, but it's useful.

Description: Fight the infection.
 Gnome is the "GNU Network Object Model Environment"
 .
 It is a project to build a complete, user-friendly desktop based
 entirely on free software.
 .
 As the README puts it:
 .
 Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right?  You're a sysadmin,
 and someone's trying to destroy your computers.  The little people
 running around the screen are trying to infect your computers with
 Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular
 operating system. Your objective is to click the mouse on them,
 ending their potential threat.  If one of the people reaches a
 computer, it will attempt to replace your operating system with the
 virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off the screen with
 your vital software.  The game ends when only 0 or 1 of your
 computers is being productive.  Additionally, some computers are
 connected with network cables. When one computer on a network becomes
 infected, a spark will be sent down the cable, and will infect the
 computer on the other end when it reaches there.

Description: GTK-based Notepad editor
 This is an easy-to-use, yet fairly feature-rich, simple text editor
 for Unix based systems running X11 and using GTK (the Gimp ToolKit).
 Gnotepad+ was designed to have as little bloat as possible, while
 still providing many of the common features found in a modern
 GUI-based text editor.  It is still fairly light-weight, especially
 for the features it offers, and aims to remain that way.
 .
 The "+" in gnotepad+ is there to differentiate it from other
 GTK-based text editors which may call themselves "gnotepad".
 Additionally, gnotepad+ is not intended to be fancy, so it leverages
 its text editing capabilities on the GTK Text Widget.  Hence, if you
 are looking for a programmers's editor, look for another text editor
 or help improve the GTK Text Widget.

Description: A versatile News and mailing list reader for Emacsen
 Gnus is a message-reading laboratory.  This is by far the most
 powerful and extensible news reader that I am aware of. It will let
 you look at just  about anything as if it were a newsgroup.  You can
 read mail with it,  you can browse directories with it, you can ftp
 with it---you can even read news with it! It handles single file
 groups, MH format folders, mbox files, digests, knows about POP,
 etc. It can split incoming mail ala procmail.
 .
 This version of gnus handles MIME natively. It adds offline reading
 capability with gnus-agent. It is not compatible with older versions
 of TM (since a large number of hooks and variables have changed to
 allow that). NOTE: Please do not use tm-gnus with  this version.
 .
 Instead of boring old KILL files, it has an adaptive multifaceted
 scoring mechanism -- you add or reduce the score of the article based
 on rules, and a component of the score comes in from your past
 behaviour -- for example, articles similar to ones you read and saved
 get higher scores. This adaptive mechanism is one of the most
 interesting part of Gnus.
 .
 Gnus tries to empower people who read news the same way Emacs
 empowers people who edit text.  Gnus sets no limits to what the user
 should be allowed to do.  Users are encouraged to extend Gnus to make
 it behave like they want it to behave.  A program should not control
 people; people should be empowered to do what they want by using (or
 abusing) the program.
 .
 Gnus comes by default with XEmacs, but this is a stand alone package
 that replaces the stock Gnusii.

Description: A generic audio mixer (Base versions)
 gom is a generic audio mixer program; it tries to provide a complete

 (run time) independence, arbitrary mixer selection, loading and saving
 of mixer settings, volume fading, verbosity-level driven output,
 "Un*x-like scripting support", etc.
 .
 At the moment, gom only supports the Open Sound System (OSS) sound
 driver. OSS comes with the Linux kernel as free software called
 OSS/Free, and is available for a number of other platforms.
 .
 Apart from the exhaustive command line interface described here, gom
 optionally has two built-in interactive interfaces (that I call
 gomiis, gom interactive interfaces;): a terminal gomii using ncurses,
 and a X gomii using the xview toolkit.  All gomiis support adjustable

Description: Guess PC disk partition table, find lost partitions
 Gpart is a tool which tries to guess the primary partition table of a
 PC-type disk in case the primary partition table in sector 0 is
 damaged, incorrect or deleted.
 .
 It is also good at finding and listing the types, locations, and
 sizes of inadvertently-deleted partitions, both primary and logical.
 It gives you the information you need to manually re-create them
 (using fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk, etc.).
 .
 The guessed table can also be written to a file or (if you firmly
 believe the guessed table is entirely correct) directly to a disk
 device.
 .
 Supported (guessable) filesystem or partition types:
 .
      DOS/Windows FAT (FAT 12/16/32)
      Linux ext2
      Linux swap partitions versions 0 and 1 (Linux >= v2.2.X)
      OS/2 HPFS

      *BSD disklabels
      Solaris/x86 disklabels
      Minix FS
      Reiser FS
      LVM physical volumes
 .
 Other types may be added relatively easily, as separately compiled modules.

 "Grafix" is a utility originally designed to help scientists in the

 It can be used, however, for any application that wants to use X for
 drawing pictures, functions or other graphic objects in a convenient
 interactive manner or even for writing a graphical user interface for any task.
 .
 Grafix should be considered as a layer between an application and the X Window
 system built up of a bunch of basic classes as building elements.
 The simplest way of using it is to define instances of these classes.
 For more complicated programs the user has to define own derivations to the
 basic classes.

Description: Transfer sound from gramophone records to CD
 GramoFile enables you to record audio from (for example) gramophone
 records, process the signal and listen to the results. Because sound
 files in .WAV-format are used, it is possible to exchange the files
 with many other programs. Cdrecord(1) can burn CD-Recordables of these,
 so you can make CDs with the music of your favorite records.  The user
 interface of GramoFile has a windows-like look-and-feel, making it
 fairly easy to use.
 .
 One of the most important parts of GramoFile is the ability to process
 digital audio signals. Through the application of several filters it
 is possible to accomplish a significant reduction of disturbances like
 ticks and scratches. These filters have been programmed in such a fashion
 that they can be applied in any order (and multiple times) in a single
 run, thus avoiding the use of temporary files. It is possible to adjust
 the properties of each filter independently, so in every situation an
 optimal result can be achieved.
 .
 Another interesting feature is the track splitting. Just make one .wav
 file of an entire side of an record and GramoFile will detect where
 the individual tracks are located. This happens fully automatically,
 without need to set any options. More experienced users may fine-tune
 the algorithm, or change the detected track starts and ends, but
 generally that will not be necessary. Track-times are saved in an
 editable (plaintext) .tracks file, that will be used during the signal
 processing to produce one processed .wav file for each individual track.
 .
 To record and play .wav files, modified versions of brec(1) and bplay(1)
 by David Monro are included. These programs provide buffered recording
 and playback, so all will go well even on a highly loaded system. Both
 programs have been modified to support the standard GramoFile user
 interface.  Brec also got a `graphical' peak level meter, and bplay a
 running time display.

 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: a language for scientific graphics programming.
 Gri is a command-driven application, as opposed to a click/point
 application.  It is analogous to latex, and shares the property that
 extensive power is the reward for tolerating a modest learning curve.
 Gri output is in industry-standard PostScript, suitable for incorporation
 in documents prepared by various text processors.
 .
 Gri can make x-y graphs, contour-graphs, and image graphs.  In
 addition to high-level capabilities, it has enough low-level
 capabilities to allow users to achieve a high degree of customization.
 Precise control is extended to all aspects of drawing, including
 line-widths, colors, and fonts.  Text includes a subset of the tex
 language, so that it is easy to incorporate Greek letters and
 mathematical symbols in labels.
 .
 The following is a terse yet working Gri program.  If it is stored in a
 file called 'example.gri', and executed with the command 'gri example', it
 will create a postscript file called 'example.ps' with the graph.
 .
   open file.dat        # open a file
   read columns x * y   # read the 1st column as x and the 3rd as y
   draw curve           # draw the data and autoscale the axes

Description: Postscript interpreter with X11 and svgalib preview support.
 Ghostscript is used for postscript preview and printing.  Usually as
 a back-end to a program such as ghostview, it can display postscript
 documents in an X11 environment.  It can also use the Linux svga
 library to display documents graphically on the Linux console.
 .
 Furthermore, it can render postscript files as graphics to be printed
 on non-postscript printers.  Supported printers include common
 dot-matrix, inkjet and laser models.
 .
 Package gsfonts contains a set of standard fonts for ghostscript.
 .
 You have to install the gs-pdfencrypt package to be able to preview
 encrypted pdf files. That package is in the nonus distribution due to
 the stupid US regulations about exporting cryptographic software
 (please look under ftp://nonus.debian.org/pub/debian-non-US to find it).
 .
 The Ghostscript World Wide Web home page is at
 http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html
 .
 This package also contains the hpdj driver contributed by
 Martin Lottermoser and the hp8xx driver by Uli Wortmann.

Description: The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- binary package
 The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
 numerical analysis.  The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
 team in C, and are meant to present a modern API for C programmers, while
 allowing wrappers to be written for very high level languages.
 Although GSL is still officially in early alpha (and hence interfaces
 may change) it has many stable pieces, including a random number
 suite, an FFT package, simulated annealing and root finding.

Description: Customizable high-resolution Pacman clone
 You have three lives, and you lose a life if you get eaten by a ghost.
 If you eat all the little dots on a level, you go onto the next level
 (if we've bothered including any). At the edge of the screen there may
 be passageways apparently going nowhere - if you follow one you will
 wrap all the way around and appear at the other side of the screen,
 yes - really, as if by magic you have been transported from one side
 of the screen to the other, and the ghosts won't know what's hit 'em.
 Also, every now and then some fruit might appear at the edge of the
 screen. Being a healthy-eating sort of guy, hatman loves fruit, so you
 should go and eat it - it's extra points, you know.
 .
 But the icing on the cake is the power-pellets. Eat one of these and
 the tables are turned. The ghosts turn gray (as one does, when one is
 scared) and now it's your turn to do some serious getting. Whilst the
 ghosts remain gray you can eat them - getting more points for each one
 you eat, once you eat them their eyes (hatman doesn't like the eyes -
 they give him indigestion) run back to the ghost's base and gets a new
 body. Don't worry about them turning back too suddenly - you will get
 a bit of a warning first.
 .
 It's easy, and it's great fun.

 controller supported (this package supports CM11A, 'x10' supports the CP290)
 X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet and allow you
 to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that is plugged
 into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of wall
 switches to control lights, fans, and many other appliances.
 This package supports the CM11A Interface (from Radio Shack), which
 supports two-way communication.  This allows for devices such as motion
 detectors to trigger scripts on your system, turning lights on, updating
 web pages, or send you e-mail.

Description: Generation of HTML documents with Python scripts.
 HTMLgen is a class library for the generation of HTML documents with
 Python scripts. It's used when you want to create HTML pages
 containing information which changes from time to time. For example
 you might want to have a page which provides an overall system summary
 of data collected nightly. Or maybe you have a catalog of data and
 images that you would like formed into a spiffy set of web pages for
 the world to browse. Python is a great scripting language for these
 tasks and with HTMLgen it's very straightforward to construct objects
 which are rendered into consistently structured web pages. Of course,
 CGI scripts written in Python can take advantage of these classes as
 well.

Description: Creating HTML using LaTeX documents.
 Hyperlatex allows you to use a LaTeX-like language to prepare
 documents in HTML (the hypertext markup language used by the world
 wide web), and, at the same time, to produce a fine printed document
 from your input. You can use all of LaTeX's power for the printed
 output, and you don't have to learn a new language for creating
 hypertext documents.
 .
 Note that Hyperlatex is not meant to translate arbitrary Latex files
 into HTML. Rather, it provides an authoring environment for writing
 printed documents and HTML documents at the same time, using an
 extended subset of Latex (excluding concepts that have no HTML
 counterpart and adding commands for new HTML concepts such as
 hyperlinks or included images).

Description: Streaming Mpeg Layer III server
 Icecast is an Internet based broadcasting system based on the Mpeg
 Layer III streaming technology.  It was originally inspired by
 Nullsoft's Shoutcast and also mp3serv by Scott Manley.  The icecast
 project was started for several reasons: a) all broadcasting systems
 were pretty much closed source, non-free software implementations, b)
 Shoutcast doesn't allow you to run your own directory servers, or
 support them, and c) we thought it would be a lot of fun.
 .
 Icecast is almost completely Shoutcast compatible as far as we've
 been able to determine.  WinAmp can both send encoded streams as well
 as stream music from icecast.  Icecast can also use the
 yp.shoutcast.com directory services and adds the ability to use other
 directory services.

 WARNING: If you're installing this package for the first time and you
 choose to use libmagick4g-lzw, install first with libmagick4g, and then
 select libmagick4g-lzw (which will deselect libmagick4g). Otherwise you
 won't be able to install with dselect.
 .
 Imagemagick is a set of programs to manipulate various image formats
 (JPEG, TIFF, PhotoCD, PBM, XPM, etc...). All manipulations can
 be achieved through shell commands as well as through a X11 graphical
 interface (display).
 .
 Possible effects: colormap manipulation, channel operations, thumbnail
 creation, image annotation, limited drawing, image distortion, etc...
 .
 Imagemagick requires the libmagick4g package to be installed. Libmagick
 comes in two flavors, a free version (without the LZW compression algorithm
 used in GIFs), and a non-free version (with the patented LZW compression
 algorithm).
 .
 This package suggests a postscript interpreter (gs) to read postscript
 files. It will however function happily without it (as long as you don't
 want to read postscript).

Description: remote mail folder access server for Pine and others
 IMAP (the Interactive Mail Access Protocol) is a mechanism for
 accessing mail folders and the messages in them remotely, ie with
 your user mail program running on a different machine to the one
 where all the messages are stored.
 .
 This protocol for remote mail access is supported by Pine and by some
 DOS/Windows and Macintosh MUA's (Mail User Agents).
 .
 If you just want to use Pine to read your email on your Linux system
 you do not need this package.
 .
 If you do install imapd you will almost certainly want to install a
 Mail Transfer Agent such as Smail or Sendmail, as remote mail
 programs which use IMAP to access incoming and saved mail will
 usually want to send mail using SMTP, often to the same machine.
 .
 You will probably also want to install Pine or some other IMAP client
 so that you can test your IMAP server.

 order to have each one's dimensions available so the next can be placed.
 This generally allows text on the remainder of the page to load much

 A set of PHP3 scripts that implement an IMAP based webmail

 IMAP, you can theoretically use an installation of IMP to check your
 mail from anywhere that you have web access.
 .
 IMP does not require an IMAP server to be running on the machine you
 install it on unless you are intending to have it use the current machine
 for it's IMAP connections. (If you are connecting to a remote server
 for your mail than you don't need IMAP)
 .
 IMP requires a database to be running if you want to use the extended
 features such as the addressbook, and prefs.  It currently uses PHPLib
 for the database interface so as long as PHPLib supports your database of
 choice your good to go.  This package is designed to support

Description: Program to support the "wheel" on some new mice
 Various new mice, including the Microsoft IntelliMouse, and the
 Logitech MouseMan+, Wheel Mouse, and others, now have a "wheel"
 button in the middle of them. This wheel button acts both as a
 standard button (by pressing it), and a wheel, which under MS
 Windows may be used for scrolling windows around.
 .
 This program supports the wheel scrolling operation by one of
 two means:
 1. Some newer X servers support mapping the wheel to buttons
    4 and 5, which imwheel then captures and supports,
 2. Using a patched version of gpm, the normal mouse events are
    passed on to the X server through /dev/gpmdata (gpm's standard
    "repeater" mode), and in addition wheel events are sent to another
    pipe, /dev/gpmwheel. imwheel picks up these events, and translates
    them.

Description: News transport system `InterNetNews' by the ISC and Rich Salz
 This is INN version 1.X, provided for sites which are not ready to
 upgrade to 2.X yet.  New installations of INN should use Debian's inn2
 package instead.
 .
 The news transport is the part of the system that stores the articles
 and the lists of which groups are available and so on, and provides
 those articles on request to users.  It receives news (either posted
 locally or from a newsfeed site), files it, and passes it on to any
 downstream sites.  Each article is kept for a period of time and then
 deleted (this is known as `expiry').
 .
 By default Debian's INN will install in a fairly simple `local-only'
 configuration.
 .
 In order to make use of the services provided by INN you'll have to
 use a user-level newsreader program such as trn.  The newsreader is
 the program that fetches articles from the server and shows them to
 the user, remembering which the user has seen so that they don't get
 shown again.  It also provides the posting interface for the user.

 kernel, it provides an excellent environment for experimenting with alternate
 mechanisms for distributing encapsulation routing updates.

 you need a lot of encapsulation links, give this daemon a try.

Description: Securely initializes IP Masquerade forwarding/firewalling
 This package contains scripts to initialize IP Masquerade for use as a
 firewall.  IP Masquerade is a feature of Linux that allows an entire network
 of computers to be connected to another network (usually the Internet) with
 only one network address on the other network.  IP Masquerade is often
 referred to as NAT (Network Address Translation) on other platforms.
 .
 By default, this package configures the system as a basic forwarding
 firewall, with IP spoofing and stuffed routing protection.  The firewall
 will allow hosts behind the firewall to get to the Internet, but not allow
 connections from the Internet to reach the hosts behind the firewall.
 However, ipmasq now features a very flexible framework where you can
 override any of the predefined rules if you so choose.  It also allows you
 to control if the rules are reinterpreted when pppd brings a link up or
 down.
 .
 This package should be installed on the firewall host and not on the
 hosts behind the firewall.
 .
 IP Masquerade requires the kernel to be compiled with CONFIG_FIREWALL,
 CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL, CONFIG_IP_FORWARD, and CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE.

Description: Start and Stop ISDN connections and display status.
 This is a small X based program that allows for easy activation and
 deactivation of the demand-dialing feature of the Linux-ISDN
 subsystem. It can also be used to initiate connections without using
 the demand-dialing feature.
 .
 It displays a symbolized traffic light. When the light is red, no
 demand-dialing is possible; when it is yellow, demand-dialing has been
 enabled but there is currently no connection using any of the ISDN
 network devices; when it is green, there is at least one active
 connection using an ISDN network device. You can interactively switch
 between red and yellow/green by clicking with the left mouse button
 into the window; the right mouse button pops up a menu to select
 between different actions --- this can be used if you want to connect
 to different providers.

Description: International Ispell (an interactive spelling corrector)
 Ispell corrects spelling in plain text, LaTeX, sgml/html/xml,
 and nroff files.  [x]Emacs and jed have nice interfaces to
 ispell, and ispell works from many other tools and from the
 command line as well.
 .
 No dictionaries are included in this package.
 Ispell looks in /usr/lib/ispell/default.{aff,hash}
 and in /usr/share/dict/words by default.  Those
 files may be provided, respectively, by an
 ispell-dictionary package and a wordlist package.
 (You must have an ispell dictionary before you can
 use ispell; a wordlist is only required for ispell's
 (L)ookup command.)
 .
 This ispell package supports either the "new-style"
 idict-<language> dictionaries or the "old-style"
 i<language> dictionaries.  It is not possible (due to
 dependencies) to use a combination of idict-<language>
 and i<language> dictionaries on the same Debian system.
 New-style dictionaries are better supported and easier
 to manage.  (For more information, please see the
 dictionaries-common package).  You should not install
 any of the new-style idict-<language> packages until
 all the languages you need are available in that form.

Description: Fast Java compiler adhering to language and VM specifications
 Jikes is a Java compiler that translates Java source files as defined in The
 Java Language Specification (Addison-Wesley, 1996) into the bytecoded
 instruction set and binary format defined in The Java Virtual Machine
 Specification (Addison-Wesley, 1996). Unlike other compilers, Jikes accepts
 the Java language only as specified: not as a subset, variant, or superset.
 .
 In addition to strictly adhering to specifications, Jikes is faster than most
 compilers and can compute the complete dependency relations in program files.
 This allows for the generation of dependency makefiles suitable for use with
 make. Jikes can also be run in incremental mode: after the initial
 compilation, Jikes waits until prompted, determines which files have been
 changed, and then does the minimal amount of work needed to bring the class
 files into a complete and consistent state. This cycle can be repeated until
 the q command is entered to end the compilation.

 This package provides the capability to create a debian
 kernel-image package by just running make-kpkg kernel_image in a
 kernel source directory tree.  It can also build the kernel source
 package as a debian file, the kernel headers package. In general, this
 package is very useful if you need to create a custom kernel, if, for
 example, the default kernel does not support some of your hardware, or
 you wish a leaner, meaner kernel.
 .
 If you are running on an intel x86 platform, and you wish to compile a
 custom kernel (why else are you considering this package?), then you may
 need the package bin86 as well.  (This is not required on other platforms).

Description: Diffs to the kernel source for Corel NetWinder
 Unfortunately in Linux 2.0.x, the different architectures have
 divergent source trees.  This is the diff to patch the native (i386)
 source to the latest (2.2.13) ARM-Linux CVS tree.  You need to run
 make-kpkg in order to build the kernel.  If you do not have a
 Corel/Rebel NetWinder, you do not need it.

Description: Linux kernel source for version 2.2.19pre17
 This package provides the source code for the Linux kernel version 2.2.19pre17.
 .
 You may configure the kernel to your setup by typing "make config"
 and following instructions, but you could get ncursesX.X-dev and
 tk4X-dev and try "make menuconfig" for a jazzier, and easier to use
 interface. Also, on intel platforms, you MUST get bin86 if
 you wish to compile the kernel sources. Ignore the suggestion to get bin86
 for non intel architectures. Also, please read the detailed documentation
 /usr/share/doc/kernel-source-2.2.19pre17/README.headers.gz.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then
 it is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package,
 which has been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image
 packages.

Description: LaTeX to HTML translator.
 LaTeX2HTML is a conversion tool that that converts documents written
 in LaTeX to HTML format. In addition, it offers an easy migration
 path towards authoring complex hypermedia documents using familiar
 word-processing concepts.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML replicates the basic structure of a LaTeX document as a
 set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using
 automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references,
 citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists of figures
 and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting
 information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes,
 paragraph breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted
 appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as
 mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images
 which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final
 HTML document.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and
 symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also
 allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw
 HTML commands. These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as
 new commands and environments from within a LaTeX document.
 .
 Pstoimg, the part of latex2html that produces bitmap images from the
 LaTeX source, can support both GIF and PNG format. The default is
 PNG.
 .
 Please note that there are certain legal limitations on the use of
 the GIF image format. Also, LaTeX2HTML would depend on netpbm-nonfree,
 which is in section non-free, if the default image style is changed to be
 GIF.

Description: A tool for statically checking C programs.
 LCLint is a tool for statically checking C programs.  With minimal
 effort, LCLint can be used as a better lint.  If additional effort is
 invested adding annotations to programs, LCLint can perform stronger
 checks than can be done by any standard lint.
 .
 LCLint does many of the traditional lint checks including unused
 declarations, type inconsistencies, use-before-definition, unreachable
 code, ignored return values, execution paths with no return, likely
 infinite loops, and fall-through cases.  Our main focus, however, is on
 more powerful checks that are made possible by additional information
 given in source code annotations.  Annotations are stylized comments
 that document certain assumptions about functions, variables,
 parameters, and types.  They may be used to indicate where the
 representation of a user-defined type is hidden, to limit where a global
 variable may be used or modified, to constrain what a function
 implementation may do to its parameters, and to express checked
 assumptions about variables, types, structure fields, function
 parameters, and function results.  In addition to the checks
 specifically enabled by annotations, many of the traditional lint checks
 are improved by exploiting this additional information.

Description: Sophisticated command-line FTP/HTTP client programs
 Lftp is a file retrieving tool that supports FTP and HTTP protocols under
 both IPv4 and IPv6.
 .
 The main two advantages over other ftp clients are reliability and ability
 to perform tasks in background. It will reconnect and reget the file being
 transferred if the connection broke. You can start a transfer in background
 and continue browsing on the ftp site. It does this all in one process. When
 you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit
 lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.
 It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a
 file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time.
 .
 This package also includes ftpget and lftpget - simple non-interactive
 tools for downloading files.

Description: An Object-Oriented Network Programming Toolkit in C++
 This package contains documentation for ACE, including the man pages.
 .
 The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE) is a freely available open source
 object-oriented (OO) framework that implements many core design patterns for
 concurrent communication software. ACE provides a rich set of reusable C++
 wrappers and framework components that perform common communication software
 tasks across a range of OS platforms. The communication software tasks
 provided by ACE include event demultiplexing and event handler dispatching,
 signal handling, service initialization, interprocess communication, shared
 memory management, message routing, dynamic (re)configuration of distributed
 services, concurrent execution and synchronization.
 .
 ACE is targeted for developers of high-performance and real-time communication
 services and applications. It simplifies the development of OO network
 applications and services that utilize interprocess communication, event
 demultiplexing, explicit dynamic linking, and concurrency. In addition, ACE
 automates system configuration and reconfiguration by dynamically linking
 services into applications at run-time and executing these services in one or
 more processes or threads.

Description: A GUI toolkit for X11, Macintosh and Windows 95/98/NT
 This is the runtime library required to run applications using the
 OpenAmulet toolkit.
 .
 The OpenAmulet Toolkit is a portable toolkit designed for the
 creation of 2D direct manipulation grapical user interfaces. It is
 written in C++ and can be used with Unix systems running X Windows
 (Motif look), PC's running Microsoft Windows NT or `95 (native look),
 or Macintosh systems running MacOS (native look).
 .
 The Amulet research project in the School of Computer Science at
 Carnegie Mellon University is creating a comprehensive set of tools
 which make it significantly easier to create graphical,
 highly-interactive user interfaces. The lower levels of Amulet are
 called the `Amulet Toolkit,' and these provide mechanisms that allow
 programmers to code user interfaces much more easily.  Support is
 provided for: object selection, save/load, undo, and constraints.
 .
 As the group at Carnegie Mellon University is no longer funded for
 its work on Amulet, some Amulet users have founded the OpenAmulet
 project which has continued its development.
 .

 While ANSI color escape codes are fairly simple, it can be hard to

 hard-coding them into your script is definitely difficult to read.  This
 module is designed to fix those problems, as well as provide a convenient
 interface to do a few things for you automatically (like resetting
 attributes after the text you print out so that you don't accidentally
 leave attributes set).

 you can sub-class it to implement your own custom SSI directives, and/or you
 can use an OutputChain to get the SSI output first, then send it through
 another PerlHandler.

 In addition to this package, you will also need the URI::Unescape

 replacement for the now obsolete CGI-modules package.
 .
 This package is destined to replace libcgi-pm-perl, but at the moment
 libcgi-pm-perl (as in the library CGI.pm) serves as the rapid
 prototyping version, and may be more featureful than this package.
 .
 This perl 5 library uses objects to create Web fill-out forms on the
 fly and to parse their contents. It provides a simple interface for
 parsing and interpreting query strings passed to CGI scripts.
 However, it also offers a rich set of functions for creating fill-out
 forms. Instead of remembering the syntax for HTML form elements, you
 just make a series of perl function calls. An important fringe benefit
 of this is that the value of the previous query is used to initialize
 the form, so that the state of the form is preserved from invocation
 to invocation.

Description: perl CGI - Simple Common Gateway Interface Class.
 This is CGI.pm, an easy-to-use Perl5 library for writing World Wide
 Web CGI scripts.
 .
 This perl library uses perl5 objects to make it easy to create Web
 fill-out forms and parse their contents. This package defines CGI
 objects, entities that contain the values of the current query string
 and other state variables. Using a CGI object's methods, you can examine
 keywords and parameters passed to your script, and create forms whose
 initial values are taken from the current query (thereby preserving
 state information). The module provides shortcut functions that produce
 boilerplate HTML, reducing typing and coding errors. It also provides
 functionality for some of the more advanced features of CGI scripting,
 including support for file uploads, cookies, cascading style sheets,
 server push, and frames.

Description: C library for developing CGI applications
 Cgic is an ANSI-C library for the creation of CGI-based World Wide Web
 applications.  Cgic provides the following:
 .
   * Parses form data, correcting for defective and/or inconsistent
     browsers
   * Transparently accepts both GET and POST form data
   * Handles line breaks in form fields in a consistent manner
   * Provides string, integer, floating-point, and single- and
     multiple-choice functions to retrieve form data
   * Provides bounds checking for numeric fields
   * Loads CGI environment variables into C strings which are always
     non-null
   * Provides a way to capture CGI situations for replay in a debugging
     environment
 .
 This package provides a static library version of cgic, examples of using
 cgic, and header files.

 creating CGI programs, and a wrapper for Database routines that enables
 you to create one program and let it run with MySQL, PostgresQL and
 mSQL (not by default) by changing only 1 define statement.
 .
 Other goodies:
  * easy to remember time conversion functions
  * a simple regular expression match function (do *you* like regcomp(3))
  * HTML and URL character en-/decoding
  * validation checks for InterNet addresses and domain names
 (mSQL is not compiled in by default!)

Description: Perl library for accessing dates
 The package provides a Perl interface to a C library which offers a
 wide variety of date calculations based on the Gregorian calendar
 (the one used in all western countries today), complying with the
 ISO/R 2015-1971 and DIN 1355 standards which specify things as what
 leap years are, when they occur, how the week numbers are defined,
 what's the first day of the week, how many weeks (52 or 53) a given
 year has, and so on.
 .
 Although the Gregorian calendar was only adopted 1582 by most (not
 all) European countries (some countries continued to use the Julian
 calendar until as late as the beginning of the 20th century!), this
 package allows you to extrapolate the Gregorian calendar back until
 the year 1.

 This is a set of routines designed to make any common date/time
 manipulation easy to do.  Operations such as comparing two times,
 calculating a time a given amount of time from another, or parsing
 international times are all easily done.  From the very beginning,
 the main focus of Date::Manip has been to be able to do ANY desired
 date/time operation easily, not necessarily quickly.  There are other
 modules that can do a small subset of the operations available in
 Date::Manip much quicker than those presented here, so if speed is a
 primary issue, you should look elsewhere.

Description: File::Tail perl module
 The File::Tail module is designed for reading files which
 are continously appended to (the name comes from the tail -f
 directive). Usually such files are logfiles of some description.
 .
 The module tries hard not to busy wait on the file, dynamicaly
 calculating how long it should wait before it pays to try reading the
 file again.
 .
 The module should handle normal log truncations ("close; move; open" or
 "cat /dev/null >file") transparently, without losing any input.

 Fltk is an attractive, fast, and flexible graphic user interface toolkit, that

 should be easy to port Forms programs to Fltk.
 .
 It also includes a very nice user interface designer to write UI code for you.
 .
 Hopefully otherwise free programs which depend on the non-free libForms
 library will be ported to fltk. Then they can go into the main Debian
 distribution.

 Boehm's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is
 intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc.
 This package is required to compile and link programs that use
 libgc5.
 .
 Since the collector does not require pointers to be tagged, it does
 not attempt to ensure that all inaccessible storage is reclaimed.
 However it has typically been more successful at reclaiming unused
 memory than most C programs using explicit deallocation.  Unlike
 manually introduced leaks, the amount of unreclaimed memory typically
 stays bounded.

Description: GD Graphics Library with gif support
 GD is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
 complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colours, cut and paste from
 other images, flood fills, and write out the result as a GIF file.
 This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, where GIF is
 the format used for inline images.
 .
 This is the runtime package of the library.

Description: General Graphics Interface runtime libraries
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 WARNING:
 .
 GGI is not quite finished.  The current Debian packages are based on
 snapshots of the GGI codebase, which is in a beta test phase.  There is
 little guarantee of binary compatibility, even between shared libraries
 with the same soname, until a proper release is made at the end of the
 beta test period.  You are encouraged to experiment with GGI in its
 present state -- the API is fairly complete and is stable.  However,
 it is probably not yet a good idea to depend on it for anything more
 critical than a graphics demo, since details of both the implementation
 and interfaces are being tweaked and fine-tuned constantly, and merely
 upgrading a target or shared library is likely to break any applications
 linked against LibGGI.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries for libGGI, the lowest-level
 drawing library provided by GGI.  Also included are libGGI drivers for
 these targets:
 .
  "memory" draws into hidden in-memory framebuffers
  "multi" draws output onto multiple displays simultaneously
  "tile" combines several displays into a single logical display
  "sub" draws output into a subwindow on another target
  "file" draws into a specially formatted file (?)
  "tele" draws on a remote teleserver (?)
 .
 Since none of the targets included here are, alone, capable of real,
 physical graphics output, you'll probably need to install at least one
 of the libggi-target packages to make any kind of sensible use of libGGI.

Description: Shared libraries for goops.
 GOOPS is the object oriented extension to Guile. Its implementation is
 derived from STk-3.99.3 by Erick Gallesio and version 1.3 of Gregor
 Kiczales `Tiny-Clos'.  It is very close in spirit to CLOS, the Common
 Lisp Object System (`CLtL2') but is adapted for the Scheme language.
 While GOOPS is not compatible with any of these systems, GOOPS
 contains a compatibility module which allows for execution of STKlos
 programs.
 .
 Briefly stated, the GOOPS extension gives the user a full object
 oriented system with multiple inheritance and generic functions with
 multi-method dispatch.  Furthermore, the implementation relies on a
 true meta object protocol, in the spirit of the one defined for CLOS
 (Gregor Kiczales: A Metaobject Protocol).

Description: User binaries for a GSM speech compressor.
 Contains user binaries for libgsm, an implementation of the European
 GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech transcoding,
 prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse excitation/long
 term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 Embperl allows you to embed perl code in your HTML documents. The
 code can be used to compute something (e.g. retrieve data from a
 database) or to produce output (e.g. display a variable). Also some
 metacommands are available which give you the ability to create
 "loops" or to conditional process your HTML document. As fours
 feature some HTML tags are specially interpreted. This allows dynamic
 table creation and an easier form processing.
 .
 Embperl can run offline, as CGI script or as module using mod_perl of
 the Apache httpd (which is the fastest approach).

 .
 HTML::EP uses Apache's mod_perl interface for speed and comes with some

Description: HTML::Mason Perl module
 Mason allows web pages and sites to be constructed from shared,

 of Perl and HTML, and can call each other and pass values back and
 forth like subroutines. Components increase modularity and eliminate
 repetitive work: common design elements (headers, footers, menus,
 logos) can be extracted into their own components where they need be
 changed only once to affect the whole site.
 .
 Other Mason features include a graphical site previewing utility, an
 HTML/data caching model, and the ability to walk through requests with
 the Perl debugger.

Description: perl HTML::SimpleParse - a bare-bones HTML parser.
 It is a bare-bones HTML parser, similar to HTML::Parser, but with
 a couple important distinctions:
 .
 First, HTML::Parser knows which tags can contain other tags, which start
 tags have corresponding end tags, which tags can exist only in the <HEAD>
 portion of the document, and so forth.  HTML::SimpleParse does not know any
 of these things.  It just finds tags and text in the HTML you give it, it
 does not care about the specific content of these tags (though it does
 distiguish between different _types_ of tags, such as comments, starting
 tags like <b>, ending tags like </b>, and so on).
 .
 Second, HTML::SimpleParse does not create a hierarchical tree of HTML
 content, but rather a simple linear list.  It does not pay any attention to
 balancing start tags with corresponding end tags, or which pairs of tags are
 inside other pairs of tags.

Description: Tools for finding the size of an image under Perl
 Image::Size is a library based on the image-sizing code in the wwwimagesize
 script, a tool that analyzes HTML files and adds HEIGHT and WIDTH tags to
 IMG directives. Image::Size has generalized that code to return a raw (X, Y)
 pair, and included wrappers to pre-format that output into either HTML or
 a set of attribute pairs suitable for the CGI.pm library by Lincoln Stein.
 Currently, Image::Size can size images in XPM, XBM, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF
 and the PPM family of formats (PPM/PGM/PBM).

 .
 Libnet features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link
 layer, as well as a host of supplementary functionality.  Still in it's
 infancy however, the library is evolving quite a bit. Additional functionality
 and stability are added with each release.
 .
 Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly applications can be whipped up
 with little effort. With a bit more time, more complex programs can be written
 (Traceroute and ping were easily rewritten using libnet and libpcap).

 The library uses an opaque data type to represent a tree structure
 made of strings, data blocks, arrays and dictionaries (key-value pair
 lists). This structure can be manipulated, written out to and read in
 from a file, and synchronized with the contents of a file.  The
 purpose of PL is to closely mimic the behavior of the property lists
 used in GNUstep/OPENSTEP (there formed with the NSString, NSData,
 NSArray and NSDictionary classes) and to be compatible with it. PL
 enables programs that use configuration or preference files to make
 these compatible with GNUstep/OPENSTEP's user defaults handling
 mechanism, without needing to use Objective-C or GNUstep/OPENSTEP

Description: Time-series data storage and display system (perl-piped)
 RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
 not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
 to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put friendly user interface on it.
 .
 This package contains a Perl interface to RRDs using command pipes.

Description: SOCKS libraries
 This is version 4.3 of SOCKS, a package that allows Unix hosts
 behind a firewall to gain full access to the internet without requiring
 direct IP reachability. It does require a SOCKS server program being
 run on a hosts that can communicate directly to hosts behind the firewall
 as well as hosts on the Internet at large.  It is based on the original
 SOCKS written by David Koblas <koblas@netcom.com>.
 .
 This package includes SOCKSified client programs of finger, ftp,
 telnet, and whois. A few other SOCKSified clients may be found on
 ftp.nec.com, in directory /pub/security/socks.cstc.

Description: Perl module to use GNU Readline library
 This is an implementation of a Perl interface to the GNU Readline
 Library.  This module gives you input line editing, input history
 management, word completion, and other similar facilities.  This module
 gives you access to almost all variables and functions documented in
 the GNU ReadLine/History Library.  This means you can write your custom
 editing function, your custom completion function, and so on with Perl.
 You may find it useful for prototyping before programming with C.

Description: Perl module to format (text) paragraphs
 This module provides the following functions:
 .
 format()        Format text into a paragraph.  Text is first broken into
                 words and then joined back together to make up the
                 paragraph.  There are numerous attributes you can set to
                 your liking.
 .
 paragraphs()    Treats each element of the array passed in as a separate
                 paragraph and passes them to format() for formatting.
                 The list returned will be then formatted into separate
                 paragraphs.
 .
 center()        Centers all the lines that were passed in.
 .
 expand()        Expand tabs into spaces.
 .
 unexpand()      Turn spaces into tabs.  First calls expand() to expand
                 tabs into spaces and then turns tabstop number of spaces
                 into tabs, you can set tabstop size with tabstop().

 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This also possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.

 Learning Letters and Numbers. This is a Linux replacement, written from
 scratch, with many improvements.  It was built using the GTK (Gimp
 ToolKit) for X.  It presently works with 1.0.x and 1.1.x, but images
 load faster with the newer library.
 .
 It is intended for children 2 and up, and is a fun learning game.  It
 helps younger chilren learn their letters and numbers, while older
 children will improve their spelling, and vocabulary skills.  It also
 helps them develop important keyboard and mouse skills too.
 .
 You can have more than one image for each word, more than one word for each
 letter, and you can add new images without recompiling too.
 .
 THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE, use it at your own risk.

Description: log out from your X session by pressing a button on your screen.
 This is a button that appears on your screen when you log into xdm.
 When you press it, it logs you out of the session.
 .
 You need to have a file called .xsession in your home dir that starts
 the logout button in the foreground and your window manager in the
 background. By putting other things in this file, you can do things
 like change your background to your favorite image, start a clock and/or
 a terminal window, or even add a rotating earth or fish tank! You can start
 any number of programs as long as you background them.
 .
 An example of .xsession is in /usr/doc/logout-button/examples and if you
 edit it choosing your favorite window manager, it will try to find and
 use it. Remember to place it in ~you/.xsession and make it executable.
 If you don't edit it, it will try to find and use the fvwm2 window mgr.
 .
 X infrastructure has a mechanism which waits for some program to exit
 indicating the user wishes to end his X session. logout-button is
 the simplest form of such a "session manager".
 .
 The example .xsession file provided in the doc/examples directory
 picks a window manager to run, starts it in the background, optionally
 starts other clients (xterm, xearth, xfishtank) also in the background
 and finally starts the session manager (logout-button) in the foreground,
 replacing the process and process ID belonging to the shell interpreting
 the .xsession. Because the infrastructure of X is waiting for this process
 to exit, when logout-button is pushed, the session is ended.

Description: Typesetting system, an alternative to (La)TeX.
 Lout reads a mark-up file - ie, a plain text file containing
 commands to control the formatting - and produces a PostScript file
 (though it can also produce formatted plain text output).
 .
 Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and
 it is much easier to understand how to do things in Lout than in
 TeX or LaTeX.  Lout comes with full documentation about writing Lout
 documents, and it produces very small and clean PostScript output.
 .
 However, it is much less widely used than (La)TeX, so there are
 fewer add-on definition packages for Lout than for (La)TeX and fewer
 local experts around to ask about problems.  You are unlikely to
 find many Lout documents floating around the 'net.

Description: Typesetting system, an alternative to (La)TeX. [Documentation]
 Lout reads a mark-up file - ie, a plain text file containing
 commands to control the formatting - and produces a PostScript file
 (though it can also produce formatted plain text output).
 .
 Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and
 it is much easier to understand how to do things in Lout than in
 TeX or LaTeX.  Lout comes with full documentation about writing Lout
 documents, and it produces very small and clean PostScript output.

Description: Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems
 The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
 V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x a vector of (nonnegative)
 variables, V1 a vector called the right hand side, and V2 a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.

MD5sum: 21c7cf94f556658bb3b86e0cd6469e41
Description: An automatic mail-processing tool
 Mailagent allows you to process your mail automatically. This has
 far more functionality than procmail, and is easier to configure
 (providing, of course, that you grok perl). As a mail processing
 tool, this slices, it dices, it ...
 .
 Given a set of lex-like rules, you are able to file mails to specific
 folders (plain Unix-style folders and also MMDF and MH ones), forward
 messages to a third person, pipe a message to a command or even post
 the message to a newsgroup.
 .
 It is also possible to process messages containing some commands.
 .
 You may also set up a vacation program, which will automatically
 answer your mail while you are not there, but more flexibly than the
 Unix command of the same name. You only need to supply a message to
 be sent and the frequency at which this will occur. Some simple macro
 substitutions allow you to re-use some parts of the mail header into
 your vacation message, for a more personalized reply.
 .
 You may also set up a generic mail server, without the hassle of the
 lower-level concerns like error recovery, logging or command parsing.
 .
 The mailagent is not usually invoked manually but is rather called
 via the filter program, which is in turn invoked by sendmail. That
 means you must have sendmail/smail on your system to use this. You
 also must have perl to run the mailagent scripts.
 .
 It is possible to extend the mailagent filtering commands by
 implementing them in perl and then having them automagically loaded
 when used.
 .
 Please note that on Debian systems, mailagent can not lock /var/spool/mail
 directory mailboxes, and thus one must put a catch all rule saving all mail
 in ones home directory. This is because Debian MDA policy requires them to
 be setgid mail, and making anything as extensible as mailagent setgid
 anything negates any benefit of having group permission protection.

Description: mail delivery agent with filtering abilities
 maildrop is a replacement for your local mail delivery agent. maildrop
 reads a mail message from standard input, then delivers the message to
 your mailbox. maildrop knows how to deliver mail to mbox-style mailboxes,
 and maildirs. "maildir" is a mailbox format used by the Qmail MTA.
 .
 maildrop can optionally read instructions from a file on how to filter
 incoming mail, and, based upon the instructions, deliver mail to alternate
 mailboxes, or forward it to somewhere else, like procmail. Unlike procmail,
 maildrop uses a structured filtering language that's a bit easier on the
 eyes.

 administer his or her list entirely from the web.
 .
 Mailman also integrates most things people want to do with mailing
 lists, including archiving, mail <-> news gateways, and so on.  It
 has all of the features you expect from such a product, plus
 integrated support for the web (including web based archiving),
 automated bounce handling and integrated spam prevention.

 Index: and Prereq: lines, it patches patchlevel.h first, it can use
 manifest files), plus it prepends some shell code which if run will
 take care adding directories, removing files, setting execute mode on
 scripts, and the like.
 .
 applypatch uses some extra data supplied by makepatch to verify both the
 patch and the source directory before applying the patch.  Afterwards it
 will clean up the directory tree plus fix up the permissions and even
 the timestamps on the patched files.

 The masqdialer system is designed to provide easily accessible control
 of multiple dialout modem connections to the members of a LAN using IP
 Masquerade for their internet connectivity. The system is a
 client/server design, so as long as a client can be written for a
 particular platform, that platform can take advantage of masqdialer's
 offerings. The masqdialer daemon runs on the linux machine, and upon an
 authorized client request, carries out the user's request.

Description: A wrapper generator for matrix languages
 Matwrap is a tool for interfacing C++ code into matrix-oriented scripting
 languages such as Octave, Tela or Matlab 5
 .
 It generates all the code to convert from the scripting language's internal
 types into the types that your C++ code understands (e.g., double, char *,
 float *, struct abc *). You do not need to understand any of the API details of
 the language to use your C++ code; just give matwrap a .h file describing
 your functions.
 .
 Brief list of features:
 .
  - Functions are automatically vectorized.
  - Arguments containing dimensions of other vector and matrix arguments can
    be computed automatically and need  not be specified.
  - Pointers to structures and classes are supported. Public member functions
    of classes may be called, and public data members may be evaluated or
    set. Inheritance is supported.

Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

 hexeditor, comes with an internal editor which can be invoked separately as
 'mcedit' and lets you do most system administration tasks.
 Browsing, unpacking and installation of Debian packages is possible by just
 pressing enter on a *.deb file. Handling of other archive formats like rpm,
 zip, zoo and tar.gz is equally supported. This version comes with undelete

Description: a conversation simulator that can learn as you talk to it
 Conversation simulators are computer programs which give the appearance of
 conversing with a user in natural language. Such programs are effective
 because they exploit the fact that human beings tend to read much more
 meaning into what is said than is actually there; we are fooled into reading
 structure into chaos, and we interpret non-sequitur as valid conversation.
 .
 MegaHAL differs from conversation simulators such as Eliza in that it uses
 a Markov Model to learn how to hold a conversation. It is possible to
 teach MegaHAL to talk about new topics, and in different languages.

 fvwm2 ones) in debian. For this purpose, menu provides an "update-menus"
 command, that will read all installed menu files (as provided by
 other packages in /usr/lib/menu), and run the frontents for various
 window-managers in /etc/menu-methods to create startup files for
 the window managers (or pdmenu).
 The user and system admin can easily override the menu files
 on a by-user or by-system bases.

Description: New logic/functional programming language
 Mercury is a new logic/functional programming language, which combines
 the clarity and expressiveness of declarative programming with advanced
 static analysis and error detection features.  Its highly optimized
 execution algorithm delivers efficiency far in excess of existing logic
 programming systems, and close to conventional programming
 systems. Mercury addresses the problems of large-scale program
 development, allowing modularity, separate compilation, and numerous
 optimization/time trade-offs.

Description: Rand mail handling system.
 This is the MH mail user agent (reader/sender), a command line

 excellent choice for people who receive and process a lot of mail.
 .
 Unlike most mail user agents, MH is not a single program, rather it
 is a set of program that are run from the shell.  This allows the user
 to utilize the full power of the Unix shell in coordination with MH.
 Various front-ends are available, such as mh-e (an emacs mode), xmh,
 and exmh (X11 clients).
 .
 WARNING: This package is not being actively maintained upstream.  It
 has known limitations dealing with MIME and other modern mail
 features.  The nmh package will probably eventually replace the Rand MH,
 although at this point, mh is still standard.

 This program performs the decoding of transfer encoded text type
 mime messages.  The message in its entirety is read from stdin.
 The decoded message is written to stdout; hence, this program
 behaves as a filter which may be placed wherever convenient.
 .
 It is assumed that the message has reached its point of final
 delivery and at that point 8-bit text types can be handled
 natively.  Hence, the need for transfer-encodings is not present
 any more.
 .
 Only some cases are handled:
  - encoded header fields are decoded from QP or B encoding.
  - The charset is assumed to be iso-8859-1
  - part or subparts of content-type text only are decoded
  - all other content-types are passed transparently.

 files.  It was written for use by archive maintainers but can be used
 by anyone wanting to transfer a lot of files via ftp.

 copied. File permissions, ownerships, modification times, access
 times, and sticky bits are duplicated.  Devices, pipes, and symbolic

 the mirror directory that don't exist in the control directory are
 deleted.  It naturally descends into subdirectories to all their
 depths. mirrordir tries to be as efficient as possible by making the

Description: A MIX emulator and MIXAL interpreter
 Mixal is an implementation of the imaginary computer called
 MIX and its assembly language MIXAL, which were invented
 by Donald E. Knuth in the 1960's for use in his monumental
 and yet unfinished book series "The Art of Computer Programming".
 All actual programs and all programming exercises in the series
 are written in MIXAL.
 .
 This package contains a modified version of Darius Bacon's Mixal
 implementation.  It takes a MIXAL source file, translates it to
 MIX machine code and then executes the resulting program, all in
 a single run.  The result of the assembler step cannot be extracted
 to a file.  Similarlly, one cannot take a precompiled MIX program and
 try to execute it in this emulator - only MIXAL source is accepted.
 .
 The MIX emulator does not (yet?) support floating-point operations
 nor the tape devices described in Knuth's book.  This is not fatal,
 however, and most of the programs and exercise answers in Knuth's
 book can be run in this MIXAL implementation.

Description: CD-ROM authoring tool.  Creates CD-ROM filesystem images
 mkhybrid is a pre-mastering program for CD-ROMs.  It generates an

 written to a CD-ROM using the cdrecord program.
 .
 mkhybrid is also capable of generating the System Use Sharing
 Protocol records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol.
 This is used to further describe the files in the iso9660 filesystem
 to a unix host, and provides information such as longer filenames,
 uid/gid, posix permissions, and block and character devices.
 .
 mkhybrid differs from mkisofs in that it supports the Apple Macintosh's
 HFS format, and can make CD-ROMs that contain both HFS and iso9660 trees.
 It also supports the Joliet format for Unicode filenames under Win32, and
 bootable CDs using the El Torito format.

Description: a more/less paging type program
 Most is a paging program that displays, one windowful at a time, the
 contents of a file on a terminal. It pauses after each windowful and
 prints on the window status line of the screen the file name, current
 line number, and the percentage of the file so far displayed.
 .
 Unlike other paging programs, most is capable of displaying an
 arbitrary number of windows as long as each window occupies at least
 two screen lines. Each window may contain the same file or a different
 file. In addition, each window has its own mode.
 .
 In addition to displaying ordinary text files, most can also display
 binary files as well as files with arbitrary ascii characters.

Description: GNU Nana -- improved support for assertions and logging
 GNU Nana is a freely available library providing improved support for
 assertions and logging in GNU C/C++.  In particular:
 .
    * Space/time efficient assertion checking
    * Space/time efficient program logging
    * Code-to-HTML converter giving only details of your interface
      and pre/postconditions (similar to Eiffel short form).
    * Statement and function-level tracing under GDB.
    * Logging via inline C code (as in <asser.h>) or by extraction of
      commands for gdb which results in no performance cost
      unless running in the debugger.
 .
 It was written by the author because he has written too many of these
 systems in the past for individual projects and has finally gotten tired
 of it.

 your god. On the way, you might encounter a quantum mechanic or two,
 or perhaps a microscopic space fleet, or -- if you're REALLY lucky --
 the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
 .
 There is a nethack-spoilers package available, if you're really
 desparate.

 A few utilities -- recover, for retrieving your auto-save files in case
 of a power failure, and dgn_comp and lev_comp, two utilities for making
 your own Nethack levels and dungeons, have been included in

 boots, if there are any auto-save files available.

Description: the Network Object agent daemon
 The Network Objects package provides a simple but powerful facility for
 remote method invocation in the context of Modula-3.  Under Network
 Objects, all subtypes of the object type NetObj.T are treated specially
 in that they can be passed to remote address spaces by reference.  This
 remote reference appears at the destination as a surrogate object which
 is a subtype of the original object type.  If the original type has
 methods, these methods can be remotely invoked through the surrogate.

Description: A network performance tool using LAM MPI
 NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that encapsulates
 the best of ttcp and netperf and visually represents the network
 performance under a variety of conditions. By taking the end-to-end
 application view of a network, NetPIPE clearly shows the overhead
 associated with different protocol layers. Netpipe answers such
 questions as: how soon will a given data block of size k arrive at its
 destination? Which network and protocol will transmit size k blocks
 the fastest? What is a given network's effective maximum throughput
 and saturation level?  Does there exist a block size k for which the
 throughput is maximized? How much communication overhead is due to the
 network communication protocol layer(s)? How quickly will a small (< 1
 kbyte) control message arrive, and which network and protocol are best
 for this purpose?

 One-player mode is a tad boring at the moment, because it never
 gets any faster, and there's no scoring.  This will be rectified
 at some point.
 .
 Two players can play against each other. If you fill two or three
 lines with one piece, your opponent gets respectively one or two
 unfilled lines at the bottom of his screen. If you fill four lines
 with one piece, your opponent will get four unfilled lines.

 protocol description in the documentation, and a sample robot in
 the examples.

Description: The Network Mapper
 nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it works fine
 for single hosts.  The guiding philosophy for the creation of nmap was
 TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It).  This is the Perl slogan, but
 it is equally applicable to scanners.  Sometimes you need speed, other times
 you may need stealth.  In some cases, bypassing firewalls may be required.
 Not to mention the fact that you may want to scan different protocols (UDP,
 TCP, ICMP, etc.).  You just can't do all this with one scanning mode.  And
 you don't want to have 10 different scanners around, all with different
 interfaces.  Thus I incorporated virtually every scanning technique I know
 into nmap.  Specifically, nmap supports:
 .
        Vanilla TCP connect() scanning,
        TCP SYN (half open) scanning,
        TCP FIN (stealth) scanning,
        TCP ftp proxy (bounce attack) scanning
        SYN/FIN scanning using IP fragments (bypasses packet filters),
        UDP recvfrom() scanning,
        UDP raw ICMP port unreachable scanning,
        ICMP scanning (ping-sweep), and
        Reverse-ident scanning.
 .
 nmap also supports a number of performance and reliability features such as
 dynamic delay time calculations, packet timeout and retransmission, parallel
 port scanning, detection of down hosts via parallel pings, and flexible
 target and port specification.

 full power of the Unix shell in coordination with nmh.  Various front-ends are
 available, such as mh-e (an emacs mode), xmh, and exmh (X11 clients).

 nmh was originally based on MH version 6.8.3, and is intended to be a (mostly)
 compatible drop-in replacement for MH.

Description: Heavy-duty USENET news reader (curses-based client)
 The motto of nn is it's expanded name, which is "No News is good
 news, but nn is better", and the nn newsreader is designed to let you
 minimize the amount of time you spend reading news (or, more
 realistically, to allow you to follow even more newsgroups :-).
 .
 Nn allows you to quickly select articles of interest and skip the
 rest.  It also supports efficient article killing and selection of
 articles by author and subject.
 .
 This version of nn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the
 Network News Transfer Protocol), and can make use of your NNTP
 server's NOV database, if configured.  You must have a news server
 available - large sites usually provide a site-wide server.  (For
 those familiar with 'nn', this is a client-only version.)
 .
 (Having recently used both nn and trn, I think it's a toss-up as to
 which is best, as trn seems to include many of nn's best features.
 If you're a diehard nn user, "trn -x -XX" will start trn in a mode
 which somewhat resembles nn.)

Description: a Relational Database Management System for Unix.
 NoSQL is a fast, portable, relational database management system without
 arbitrary limits, (other than memory and processor speed) that runs under,
 and interacts with, the UNIX Operating System.
 .
 It uses the Operator/Stream DBMS paradigm described in "Unix Review",
 March, 1991, page 24, entitled "A 4GL Language".  There are a number of
 "operators" that each perform a unique function on the data.  The "stream"
 is supplied by the UNIX Input/Output redirection mechanism.  Therefore each
 operator processes some data and then passes it along to the next operator
 via the UNIX pipe function.  This is very efficient as UNIX pipes are
 implemented in memory.  NoSQL is compliant with the "Relational Model".

 NTP was designed with attention to details which might introduce
 systematic bias into the computations, and the protocol is capable of
 synchronizing with even the most precise external time sources.
 .

 ntpd daemons, load the optional Debian package 'ntp-doc'.

 The Perl suggestion is only to allow use of the entirely optional ntpsweep

Description: Objective-C compiler
 Portable Object Compiler (objc-poc) is an Objective-C compiler.
 .
 Includes:
   - a modern, portable, "all C" Objective C runtime
     There's absolutely no assembly language needed, nor is there
     a dependency on stack layout, register allocation conventions etc.
     Most other runtimes, were derived from pre-"all C"-Stepstone
     runtimes, so this is an important point of difference.
   - "objpak", the "Object Pak" Objective C Collection Classes
     Simple, powerful set of classes.  Very portable.
     Can be used to develop with different compilers, then
     port with 'objc'.  Compatible with ICpak101, the collection class
     library described in Brad Cox book, and used by existing
     Objective-C packages that were developed with Stepstone objc.
   - "cakit", the "Computer Algebra Kit" Objective C classes
     Small, concise, interface to a large set of classes for
     polynomial computing and arbitrary precision integer arithmetic.

Description: ML language implementation with a class-based object system
 Objective Caml is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 Objective Caml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode
 which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,
 generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is
 portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of
 generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation:
 almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used
 either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
 standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.
 The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number
 of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but
 the generated programs deliver excellent performance (better than
 Standard ML of New Jersey 1.08 on our tests), while retaining the
 moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler.
 .
 Before the introduction of objects, Objective Caml was known as Caml
 Special Light. Objective Caml is almost upwards compatible with Caml
 Special Light, except for a few additional reserved keywords that have
 forced some renamings of standard library functions. The script
 tools/csl2ocaml in the distribution can be used to automate the
 conversion from Caml Special Light to Objective Caml.

 .
 Using it instead of the regular gnuplot interface, you have the
 following advantages:
 .
   - Use a superior plotting package, having access to dozens of
     plotting commands, enabling you to customize your plots at your
     will.
 .
   - Still use the same plot commands that you are familiarized, if you
     really want to.
 .
   - Have some new and long waited plotting command scripts.
 .
 Besides having access to all PLplot API commands, and all Octave usual
 commands, some with some improvements, new commands are
 available. They are: autostyle, ginput, gtext, legend, cmap, pldef,
 save_fig, set_view, shade, stripc, stripc_add, stripc_del, tdeblank,
 text, xticks, and zoom.

Description: Online Mirror Daemon
 Duplicates directory hierarchies between several machines.
 The omirr package consists of the online mirror daemon in.omirrd and a
 kernel patch.  The daemon supports mirroring of directory hierarchies
 between several machines.  It distributes files, file contents and
 file attributes to remote machines, comparable to the rdist(1)
 program, but it has several differences compared to rdist.
 .
 Firstly, it synchronizes the files online, usually immediately, using
 an interface to the local kernel which notifies the daemon about all
 file system modifications. This results in equivalent file system
 contents of the mirrored hierarchies on all machines. The daemon is
 started once, usually at boot time and then runs continuously. In
 contrast, the rdist program is started manually or from cron, then
 distributes its files and terminates.
 .
 Secondly, it allows symmetric mirroring. With rdist, one file system
 hierarchy is the master version used to update the others. The
 hierarchies synchronized by in.omirrd are all treated equally,
 i.e. there is no master copy. The file system modifications are
 time-stamped and in.omirrd uses the latest version of each file. This
 is the same as concurrently modifying the same file from two Unix
 processes: the last modification takes effect. But, since in.omirrd
 does not support file (or even record) locking, it should not be used
 for file system hierarchies with a lot of concurrent updates on
 several machines or for files usually accessed using locking
 mechanisms, like database files.
 .
 Thirdly, it can synchronize several remote machines concurrently.
 rdist updates multiple hosts sequentially.

 Pascal, designed by the renowned Niklaus Wirth. It combines the popular
 and proven design of Pascal (strict type system, easy to read code,
 easy to follow program flow, possibility to naturally structure your
 source code) with the modularity of Modula-2 and enhances both of them
 with clean, simple but powerful object-oriented concepts, including
 inheritance, dynamic type information, virtual methods, various access
 rules on class and module basis and a built-in garbage collector.
 .
 OO2C is the first compiler of the Optimizing Oberon-2 Compiler (OOC)
 project.  OOC's goal is to provide optimizing native code Oberon-2
 compilers for a number of popular computer architectures.  This version
 is limited to 32-bit platforms.

Description: Development files for OpenAmulet, a GUI toolkit
 This package contains the header files and the development library
 for OpenAmulet. Install this package if you wish to develop your own
 programs using the OpenAmulet toolkit.
 .
 The OpenAmulet Toolkit is a portable toolkit designed for the
 creation of 2D direct manipulation grapical user interfaces. It is
 written in C++ and can be used with Unix systems running X Windows
 (Motif look), PC's running Microsoft Windows NT or `95 (native look),
 or Macintosh systems running MacOS (native look).
 .
 The Amulet research project in the School of Computer Science at
 Carnegie Mellon University is creating a comprehensive set of tools
 which make it significantly easier to create graphical,
 highly-interactive user interfaces. The lower levels of Amulet are
 called the `Amulet Toolkit,' and these provide mechanisms that allow
 programmers to code user interfaces much more easily.  Support is
 provided for: object selection, save/load, undo, and constraints.
 .
 As the group at Carnegie Mellon University is no longer funded for
 its work on Amulet, some Amulet users have founded the OpenAmulet
 project which has continued its development.

Description: Options Parsing Tool shared library
 opt is a subroutine library which facilitates the convenient input
 of parameters to a C program. Parameters are parsed from a command
 line, with further facilities for reading options from files, from
 environment strings, or from an interactive environment. The aim of
 the opt package is to permit programs to be both user- and
 programmer- friendly. The package attempts to on the one hand
 provide a direct and relatively full-featured input interface to the
 ultimate user of the program, and at the same time impose a minimal
 amount of work on the programmer to "attach" the package to his or
 her software. It is similar to GNU's (and AT&T's old) getopts
 package, but with a different interface that might be easier to use.

Description: Generator for One Time Passwords
 otp  creates  key  and password lists for verification and
 security purposes in a variety of formats.  Keys can be of

 case), and alphabetic passwords  can  either  be  entirely
 random (most secure) or obey the digraph statistics of En-
 glish text (easier to remember when transcribing, but less
 secure).
 .
 For  computer  applications,  for  example  one-time login
 passwords, otp can create a file containing the MD5 signa-
 ture of each of the generated keys.  This permits the com-
 puter to verify keys without the need to store the keys in
 plaintext.

Description: Pascal to C translator
 P2c is a tool for translating Pascal programs into C. The input
 consists of a set of source files in any of the following Pascal
 dialects: HP Pascal, Turbo/UCSD Pascal, DEC VAX Pascal, Oregon Software
 Pascal/2, Macintosh Programmer's Workshop Pascal, Sun/Berkeley Pascal,
 Texas Instruments Pascal, Apollo Domain Pascal. Modula-2 syntax is also
 supported.
 .
 Output is a set of .c and .h files that comprise an equivalent program
 in any of several dialects of C. Output code may be kept machine and
 dialect-independent, or it may be targeted to a specific machine and
 compiler. Most reasonable Pascal programs are converted into fully
 functional C which will compile and run with no further modifications,
 although p2c sometimes chooses to generate readable code at the expense
 of absolute generality.

Description: A framework for 3D graphics production
 Panorama will include modeling, rendering, post-processing,
 animating, etc.  Functionally, it is structured as an API, composed
 by two dynamic libraries, and several plugins, that you can
 optionally load in runtime.  A simple console mode front-end for this
 API is included in the package, that can load a scene description in
 one of the supported scene languages and then outputs a single image
 file in any of the supported graphic formats.
 .
 Its main features are:
 .
   - Plugin architecture. Most elements in the system are
     plugin's. This means components are loaded as needed, and can be
     substituted, added, etc without recompiling anything. This will
     let third parties distribute their plugins outside the main
     distribution.
 .
   - Object oriented scene description language, with classes,
     inheritance, etc. It's easy to use, and has a simple syntax.
 .
   - Scene language is a plugin itself, so any other scene language
     can be used instead.
 .
   - Several rendering methods are possible without any other change
     in input scene file. Currently supported methods are raytracing
     and zbuffer, but other methods are being tested and will be
     incorporated in the future.
 .
   - A postprocessing system lets you apply filters to the whole image
     after it has been generated by renderer.
 .
   - Similarly, there are object filters, that you can apply to an
     object in the rendering process. This means a new class of
     effects (e.g. a cartoon-like object in a photorealistic scene).
 .
   - Materials have a BSDF (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution
     Function) that encapsulates its properties with respect to the
     light. Now, only Lambertian and Phong BSDF's are implemented, but
     more sophisticated ones will follow, like Schlick's, Ward's, etc.

Description: Portable Archive Interchange
 Pax is an archiving utility that reads and writes tar and cpio formats,
 both the traditional ones and the extended formats specified in IEEE 1003.1.
 It handles multi-volume archives and automatically determines the format
 of an archive while reading it.  Three user interfaces are
 supported: tar, cpio, and pax.  The pax interface was designed by IEEE
 1003.2 as a compromise in the chronic controversy over which of tar or
 cpio is best.
 .
 This is the free OpenBSD's version written by Keith Muller.
 .
 This package will eventually be obsoleted by the release of GNU paxutils.

 PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded
 capabilities, such as modems, increased memory, etc.  Some desktop PCs
 can accept PCMCIA cards as well, although this is rare.
 .
 Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package.  It
 includes a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a card
 manager daemon that can respond to card insertion and removal events,
 loading and unloading drivers on demand.  It supports ``hot swapping''
 of PCMCIA cards, so cards can be inserted and ejected at any time.
 .
 The actual kernel modules required for this package are contained in
 the pcmcia-modules-<kernel version> package, where <kernel version> is
 the version of the kernel for which the modules have been compiled.

 .
 Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it
 is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple
 machines.  For example, in the CS dept. of MUN, pdksh is installed on a
 variety of machines including Suns, HPs, DecStations, pcs running Linux,
 etc., and is the login shell of ~4500 users.

Description: The perl data language. Perl extensions for numerics.
 PDL (``Perl Data Language'') gives standard perl the ability to COMPACTLY
 store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large N-dimensional data arrays
 which are the bread and butter of scientific computing.  The idea
 is to turn perl in to a free, array-oriented, numerical language
 in the same sense as commercial packages like IDL and MatLab. One
 can write simple perl expressions to manipulate entire numerical arrays
 all at once. For example, using PDL the perl variable $a can hold a
 1024x1024 floating point image, it only takes 4Mb of memory to store
 it and expressions like $a=sqrt($a)+2 would manipulate the whole image
 in a few seconds.
 .
 A simple interactive shell (perldl) is provided for command line use
 together with a module (PDL) for use in perl scripts.

 A scripting language with delusions of full language-hood, Perl is used
 in many system scripts and utilities.

 This is a stripped down Perl with only essential libraries.  To make
 full use of Perl, you'll want to install the perl-5.005 package
 which supplements this one.

 PFE (Portable Forth Environment) is a programming environment for the
 programming language Forth.
 .
 pfe is nonstandard in that it claims to conform to the draft proposed
 American National Standard for the programming language Forth. In all
 other respects it conforms to this new standard. All word sets
 mentioned in the standard including their extensions are built into
 pfe and are immediately available. The only missing words are those
 related to the assembler. Being portable, pfe has no built-in
 assembler.
 .
 Additionally pfe is compatible to the FORTH 83 Standard and has
 several words built in that stem from the FIG Forth model. The goal is
 to be familiar.
 .
 PFE is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU
 Library General Public License (LGPL).  It has been written by Dirk
 Uwe Zoller in 1995, but is not maintained anymore.

 .
 This simulates the sound of a CW pileup. The greater the number
 of voices the more difficult the program is.
 The idea is based on the tapes used at Amateur Radio Conventions
 to test people's CW skills. However it is more random and can be
 made more difficult!
 .
 You have to use a adlib or soundblaster compatible soundcard.

Description: A Package dependency checker and install ordering tool
 It does dependency checks, if you wish. It knows the difference
 between installed, new (and available) packages, and the relationship
 fields (pre-depends, depends, recommends, and suggests). (For
 example, the current packages list need not be read in unless you
 want dependency checks; you may already have done that and now merely
 wish an ordering). It comes with a Test::Harness test suite, to
 protect the world against my typos. Oh, it knows about epochs as well
 if your dpkg does. This could be the basis of mass compiling the
 packages on a new architecture, or to build a release from scratch.
 .
 It creates associative arrays of currently installed packages
 (/var/lib/dpkg/status), and new packages (given a packages file at
 the command line). Then, in the checking dependency phase, for each
 package in the new packages list, it looks at the dependencies, and
 ensure that each dependency is satisfied in either the new list or
 the installed list. If the directive is satisfied from the list of
 new packages, that package is added to the list of packages to be
 topographically sorted. It understands Pre-Depends and will insert
 breaks into the sorted list to separate the installation process into
 separate runs as required to satisfy Pre-Dependencies.
 .
 All this is a set of perl5 libraries, so people may use the API in
 their own scripts.

Description: Scientific plotting library
 PLplot is relatively small, portable, freely distributable, and is rich
 enough to satisfy most users.  It has a wide range of plot types including
 line (linear, log), contour, 3D, fill, and almost 1000 characters
 (including Greek and mathematical) in its extended font set.  The package
 is designed to make it easy to quickly get graphical output; only a
 handful of function calls is typically required.  For more advanced use,
 virtually all aspects of plotting are configurable.
 .
 APIs are provided for C, C++, and Fortran (Tcl/Tk bindings are available
 in a separate package plplot-tcl).
 .
 A program for rendering Tektronix vector files is also included in
 this package.
 .

Description: Polytechnique Montreal Modula-3
 The Modula-3 distribution of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal is based
 on the DEC SRC Modula-3 programming environment.
 .
 Modula-3 is a systems programming language that descends from Mesa,
 Modula-2, Cedar, and Modula-2+. It also resembles its cousins Object
 Pascal, Oberon, and Euclid.
 .
 The goal of Modula-3 is to be as simple and safe as it can be while
 meeting the needs of modern systems programmers. Instead of exploring new
 features, they studied the features of the Modula family of languages
 that have proven themselves in practice and tried to simplify them into
 a harmonious language. They found that most of the successful features
 were aimed at one of two main goals: greater robustness, and a simpler,
 more systematic type system.
 .
 Modula-3 retains one of Modula-2's most successful features, the
 provision for explicit interfaces between modules. It adds objects and
 classes, exception handling, garbage collection, lightweight processes
 (or threads), and the isolation of unsafe features.
 .
 A large number of platform independent libraries are available for easily
 constructing distributed, graphical, multi-threaded applications.

 It's based on gettext, but it makes smaller binary message catalogs
 (a must when one is making internationalized boot floppies). The
 programmer may use his gettexttified C source files just applying one
 small change to the main() function. The translator will work with the
 well known PO format.

 .
 As compared to MySQL, PostgreSQL is more fully featured; the trade-off is
 that it is slower, though again, each release sees improvements in
 efficiency.

Description: Configurable UPS monitoring daemon
 Assuming you have a relay-based "dumb" UPS that corresponds with your
 machine via a serial connection, you should be able to configure powstatd
 in just a few minutes. It is easily configured, and can be expected to
 support most "dumb" UPS supplies.
 .
 UPS models known to work:
  CyberPower PowerSL series
  CyberPower Power2000 1500VA
  CyberPower Power99 325VA, 400VA, 500VA and 720VA
  Some older CyberPower 385VA and 450VA models
  TrippLite Internet Office 500 UPS
  Various older APC units.
 .
 Powstatd can also be configured to allow a master machine to control
 (Via a network connection) up to 2 (by default) additional slave
 machines connected to the same UPS. This allows you to run several
 machines off the same UPS, with only one of the machines actually
 reading the UPS status over the serial line.
 .

Description: Display netpbm graphics on framebuffer devices
 The ppmtofb package supports displaying netpbm-format graphics
 (PBM, PGM and PPM) on systems with framebuffer devices (available
 with 2.1 kernels on all platforms and 2.0 kernels on m68k).  With the
 separate fbview package, you can display virtually any picture format
 on any framebuffer.
 .
 ppmtofb supports virtually all framebuffer devices, including vesafb
 and the experimental VGA16 framebuffer for PCs.  On Amigas it can
 take advantage of the Hold and Modify (HAM) modes for virtual
 truecolor display.
 .
 This package was previously called "ppmtoagafb"; however, since it
 works with more framebuffers now the name "ppmtofb" was chosen.

Description: The Project Revision Control System
 PRCS, the Project Revision Control System, is the front end to a set
 of tools that (like CVS) provide a way to deal with sets of files and
 directories as an entity, preserving coherent versions of the entire
 set.
 .
 PRCS was designed primarily by Paul Hilfinger, with input and
 modifications by Luigi Semenzato and Josh MacDonald. PRCS is written
 and maintained by Josh MacDonald.
 .
 Its purpose is similar to that of SCCS, RCS, and CVS, but (according
 to its authors, at least), it is much simpler than any of those
 systems.
 .
 Emacs-Lisp support is distributed in a separate package, prcs-el.
 .

 .
 ProcMeter displays constantly updating graphs of system information.
 Many different graphs are supported, including:
 .
  Total cpu usage, cpu used by user, niced, or system processes, cpu idle
  time, load average, number of context switches, number of processes. Amount
  of swapping, paging, swap in, page in, swap out, page out. Amount of disk
  accesses, reads, writes, or interrupts. MB of free, used, buffer, or cached
  memory. Amount of swap space used. Number of packets received or transmitted
  over local interfaces, ethernet, or slip/ppp. Number of collisions on
  ethernet, battery life stats.
 .
 As if all that wasn't enough, procmeter also allows you to write programs
 that communicate with procmeter and add new graphs to the display.
 .
 Procmeter can also log statistics to a file, and play it back later.

Description: Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon
 A powerful replacement for wu-ftpd, this File Transfer Protocol
 daemon supports hidden directories, virtual hosts, and per-directory
 ".ftpaccess" files.  It uses a single main configuration file, with a
 syntax similar to Apache.
 .
 Because of the advanced design, anonymous-FTP directories can have
 an arbitrary internal structure (bin, lib, etc, and special files are
 not needed).  Advanced features like multiple password files and
 upload/download ratios are also supported.
 .

Description: Propagate X selections between displays
 propsel is useful to people who work with more than a single X11 display
 on their desk.  It allows one to paste into a xterm on one display the
 contents of the selection of another display.  For example, it's useful
 for situations where you have a URL on one display, and want to access
 it with a browser running on another display.  You can select the URL,
 click "propagate", move over to the other display, and then paste into
 the browser.
 .
 If you have the two displays on the same desk, you might be more
 interested in the package x2x.  However, x2x can only link two displays
 at once, whereas propsel can propagate selections between up to
 8 displays.

Description: An Emacs major mode for editing SGML documents.
 PSGML is a major mode for editing SGML documents.  It contains a
 simple SGML parser and can work with any DTD. (The most popular
 nowadays are the HTML DTD's. This package turns your emacs into the
 one of most powerful HTML editors and will be ultimately flexible as
 well, since you could upgrade your editor by just installing new
 DTD's). Functions provided includes menus and commands for inserting
 tags with only the contextually valid tags, identification of
 structural errors, editing of attribute values in a separate window
 with information about types and defaults, and structure based
 editing.
 .
 Since psgml parses the DTD to allow you to edit SGML documents, you do
 need to have the DTD's installed in order to use psgml. Since psgml
 installs itself as an HTML mode in Emacs, it depends on sgml-data. Some
 other packages which also provide SGML DTD's are suggested, like
 debiandoc-sgml and linuxdoc-sgml.
 .
 SGML, a language for encoding the structure of a document, is an ISO
 standard: ISO 8879:1986 "Information processing - Text and office
 systems - Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)".
 .
 This is a standard package for XEmacs.

Description: Document templates with fill-in fields.
 Document templates provide for creation of textual documents, such as
 HTML pages, from template source by inserting data from python objects
 and name-spaces.  Document templates are especially useful when it is
 desirable to separate template text from python program source.  For
 example, HTML templates may be edited by people who know HTML, and
 don't know python, while associated python code may be edited by
 people who know python but not HTML.

Description: Improves integration between Python and C++ classes
 A lightweight mechanism, named "ExtensionClass",
 http://www.digicool.com/releases/ExtensionClass/ExtensionClass-1.0.2.tar.gz,
 has been developed for making Python
 extension types more class-like.  Classes can be developed in an
 extension language, such as C or C++, and these classes can be
 treated like other python classes:
 .
  - They can be sub-classed in python,
  - They provide access to method documentation strings, and
  - They can be used to directly create new instances.
 .
 An example class shows how extension classes are implemented and how
 they differ from extension types.
 .
 Extension classes provide additional extensions to class and
 instance semantics, including:
 .
  - A protocol for accessing subobjects "in the context of" their
    containers.  This is used to implement custom method types
    and environmental acquisition.
  - A protocol for overriding method call semantics.  This is used
    to implement "synchronized" classes and could be used to
    implement argument type checking.
  - A protocol for class initialization that supports execution of a
    special '__class_init__' method after a class has been
    initialized.
 .
 Extension classes illustrate how the Python class mechanism can be
 extended and may provide a basis for improved or specialized class
 models.

Description: Numerical (matrix-oriented) Mathematics for Python
 The Numeric Extensions to Python (NumPy) add powerful
 multi-dimensional array objects to the wonderful general purpose
 programming language Python. These new objects give Python the number
 crunching power of numeric languages like Matlab and IDL while
 maintaining all of the advantages of the general-purpose programming
 language Python.
 .
 These extensions add two new object types to Python, and then include
 a number of extensions that take advantage of these two new objects:
 .
  - Multidimensional Array Objects
    * Efficient arrays of homogeneous machine types (floats, longs,
      complex doubles, ?)
    * Arbitrary number of dimensions
    * Sophisticated structural operations
  - Universal Function Objects
    * Supports mathematical functions on all python objects
    * Very efficient for Array Objects
  - Simple interfaces to existing numerical libraries:
    * Linear Algebra (LAPACK)
    * Fourier Transforms (FFTPACK)
    * Random Numbers (RANLIB)

Description: `GNU S' - A language and environment for statistical computing.
 R is described by its authors as "not unlike" S, which is a language
 developed at Bell Laboratories for statistical computing and graphics.
 It provides support for a variety of statistical and graphical analyses.
 R is a true computer language which contains a number of control-flow
 constructions for iteration and alternation.  It allows users to add
 additional functionality by defining new functions.  Fortran and C
 code can be linked and called at run time.
 .
 S is the statistician's Matlab and R is to S what Octave is to Matlab.
 .
 Versions 0.90.0 and higher have R functions CRAN.packages, install.packages,
 and update.packages that can be used to select and update R packages from the
 Comprehensive R Archive Network.  The Debian packages r-cran, r-cran-non-free,

 This includes linear adding of disks, RAID-0, RAID-4 and -5.
 .
 'New-style' RAID arrays have a lot features not present in the
 'older' RAID arrays, including autodetection. Old arrays can be upgraded
 with this package, and it is mostly a good idea to use this package
 when creating new RAID arrays.
 .
 In order to use this package, you must have a kernel with RAID drivers
 which aren't yet included in the stock kernels. You can find kernel

 Ras is a program that adds m extra files to a set of n files, such
 that the contents of the n original files can be regenerated from any
 n of the n+m original files and extra files. Normally, these extra
 files will all be 6 bytes larger then the largest of the original
 files, but ras has a mode in which the extra files are exactly the
 same size as the original files.
 .
 Ras was originally intended for transporting a large file split over
 several floppy disks in a manner resilient to the corruption of a few
 of the disks, and a pair of example shell scripts to do this (rassplit
 and rasmerge) is included in the distribution.

 then convert the phonemes to a sequence of vocal tract parameters, and
 then synthesise the sound a vocal tract would make to say the sentence.
 Recite can perform a subset of these operations, so it can be used to
 convert text into phonemes, or to produce an utterance based on vocal
 tract parameters computed by some other program.

Description: Reports bugs in the Debian distribution.
 This package allows you to report bugs in the Debian distribution and
 other programs.  It is similar to the "bug" package, but has the
 following differences from "bug":
 .
  * It's smarter about files that can be found in multiple packages.
  * You can use any of several mail readers to edit and send the
    report, instead of using the built-in mailer.  It also has a
    built-in SMTP capability, for use on systems without an installed MTA.
  * It checks the bug tracking system for outstanding reports, using
    either LDAP or HTTP, and can check local mirrors of the BTS.
  * It supports a number of other debbugs servers (GNOME, KDE, TDYC, Mandrake).
  * You can sign bug reports with GnuPG or PGP.
  * Supports per-user and system-wide configuration files.
  * Includes a standalone "BTS browser" program, querybts.
 .
 It is intended to be mostly "user-compatible" with bug; i.e., it
 looks and works similarly from the user's perspective, as far as is
 reasonable (given the larger feature set of reportbug).

 rinetd redirects TCP connections from one IP address and port to another.
 rinetd is a single-process server which handles any number of connections
 to the address/port pairs specified in the file /etc/rinetd.conf. Since
 rinetd runs as a single process using nonblocking I/O, it is able to
 redirect a large number of connections without a severe impact on the
 machine. This makes it practical to run services on machines inside an IP
 masquerading firewall.

Description: A command line Diamond Rio MP3 player controller
 rio is a Diamond Rio MP3 CLI controller program
 The home website is http://www.world.co.uk/sba/index.htm
 This program supports file uploads and downloads, on both
 the Classic Rio and the 64 Meg Rio, and supports plug in cards.
 .
 The default port is 0x378, if your rio is plugged into a
 different port, you will need to use the -p option.
 .
 This program directly controls various IOports.  The program need to
 be run as root, or setuid root.
 .
 If you execute the following line as root after package installation,
 the program will be setuid root.
 .
 chmod 4755 /usr/bin/rio
 .
 Alternately, there is a debconf'd script that will allow you
 to setuid root the binary (If you decide to ignore numerous warnings)
 .
 Do NOT do that unless you understand the security implications of a
 setuid binary.  See Debian bug #50510 for an explanation.

 functionality is a superset of their BSD counterparts.  In other words,
 with the rlpr package, you can do everything you can do with the BSD
 printing commands, and more.  The programs contained within the rlpr
 package are all GPL'd, and are more lightweight, cleaner and more
 secure than their BSD counterparts.

Description: Threaded, persistent, OO, scheme interpreter and compiler.
 RScheme is a scheme interpreter and compiler with object extensions,
 threads, a persistent store, an optional real-time garbage collector,
 and many other nifty features.
 .
 RScheme can generate byte compiled modules, or compile directly to C.
 This is quite easy with the current configuration.  See
 /usr/doc/rscheme/module-example for an example.

Description: Add on modules for RScheme from the CVS development tree.
  This package contains add-on modules for RScheme.  This package
  comes directly from the CVS module development repository at
  cvs.rscheme.org and contains all kinds of goodies including a simple
  readline implementation, pretty printer, graphics handling routines
  (including tiff, png and pnm), and an object oriented gui testbed.
  .
  Currently, there is little or no documentation for any of these
  modules, but contributions are welcome.  Installing this package
  will override the normal fshell's startup image so that fshell will
  have access to all the new modules.  In the future, this will change
  so that all of these modules are dynamically loaded on-demand.

 editting with a minimum of trial and error.

 If you have a Plan 9 terminal, you can use the Plan 9 terminal with
 sam to edit unix files, but not vice-fersa; the Plan 9 authentication
 scheme does not honor remote execution requests from a non-Plan 9
 system.

 This is the analyzer and intermediate representation for a free VHDL
 simulation system from the University of Cincinnati's Experimental
 Computation Laboratory.  "scram", SAVANT's analyzer, converts VHDL
 into the AIRE intermediate standard form. AIRE is designed to be
 extensible by the user so that they can easily insert their own back ends.
 SAVANT includes a VHDLpublishing back end and a C++ publishing back end.
 The generated C++ can be compiled and linked against the TyVis library to
 allow end to end sequential or parallel simulation of VHDL.  This version
 of the Debian package supports only sequential simulation - future releases
 should support parallel simulation as well.

Description: The Scotty and Tkined Network Management Tools.
 Scotty is a set of Tcl extensions to retrieve status information about
 TCP/IP networks.  The extensions include commands to send icmp packets
 a la ping, to lookup hostnames, to query the portmapper and mount
 daemons.  Also included are generic tcp/udp extensions as well as
 commands to query the domain name service for a, ptr, hinfo, mx and soa
 records and commands to query ntp server. log messages can be written
 by using the syslog command.  The perhaps most interesting extension is
 an interface to the SNMPv1 and SNMPv2C protocols. Tkined is a small but
 nice network management station.

 The user must have access to an account on the sending and on the
 receiving site, too.
 .
 Sendfile for Unix, which is an implementation of the SAFT protocol
 (Simple Asynchronous File Transfer) now offers you a true
 asynchronous file transfer service for the Internet.  Virtually any
 form of file can be sent, including encrypted ones.  The SAFT
 protocol will be submitted as an RFC in the near future.

Description: Control the behaviour of your cdrom device
 This program allows you to control the behaviour of your Linux cdrom
 player.  You'll need a cdrom device that complies to the new interface
 defined in linux/Documentation/cdrom/cdrom-standard.tex.  For
 kernel 2.0 this is only the cm206 drive, for kernel 2.1 this
 includes IDE and SCSI drives.
 .
 You can control: auto close, auto eject, medium type checking and
 tray locking.  You can get information on the volume name of cdroms
 and other data, and you can set the speed of your drive and choose a
 disc from a jukebox.
 .
 In order to fully exploit the possibilities, you'll need libc6 and a
 recent version of the the linux kernel, but you will get decent error
 behaviour in return.  Expect a message "No medium found" if you
 attempt to mount an empty drive or "Wrong medium type" if you try to
 mount an audio disc, instead of a whole load of kernel error
 messages.
 .
 The source of this package may be an example for cdrom player program
 developers that wish to exploit the features of the new cdrom
 interface.

Description: Controls configuration of serial ports.
 Set and/or report the configuration information associated with
 a serial port. This information includes what I/O port and which IRQ
 a particular serial port is using.
 .
 This version has a completely new approach to configuration, so if you
 have a setup other than the standard ttyS0 and 1, you will have to get
 your hands dirty.
 .
 By default, only COM1-4 are configured by the kernel, using IRQ 3 and 4.
 If you have other serial ports (such as an AST Fourport card), or
 if you have mapped the IRQs differently (perhaps COM3 and 4 to other
 IRQs to allow concurrent access with COM1 and 2) then you must have this
 package.

Description: Enhanced library for managing I/O streams (development).
 Sfio is a portable library for managing I/O streams. It provides similar
 functionality to the ANSI C Standard I/O functions known collectively as
 Stdio. However, it has a distinct interface and is generally faster and
 more robust than most Stdio implementations. Sfio also introduces a number
 of new features and concepts beyond Stdio stream I/O processing:
 .
  * Automatic locking to avoid concurrent stream accesses,
  * I/O disciplines to pre/post-process read/write data from/to streams,
  * Stream stacking for recursive processing of nested streams,
  * Stream pooling for automatic stream synchronization when I/O operations
    are performed on different streams,
  * Buffer reservation for safe access to the internal buffers of streams,
  * Robust handling of variable-sized records, and
  * Extensible printf/scanf-like formatting I/O operations.

Description: A simple, text-based file manager for GTK+
 This program is a simple file manager. It's meant to be small and fast and
 have a lot of shortcuts. You can associate actions with files (using its
 extension or its type given by file(1)). A popup menu gives you the
 available commands and shortcuts. You can have multiple views talking
 between each others. The filenames are colored using the LS_COLORS
 variable.  You can also use it as a directory traveller. It uses the gtk+
 library.
 .
 You have the ability to not use the mouse at all, using mnemonics and
 shortcuts.  This program is meant to minimize memory consumption and to be
 very fast.

 literate programming.  Thus, the Stanford GraphBase can also be regarded as a
 collection of approximately 30 essays for programmers to enjoy reading,
 whether or not they are doing algorithmic research.  The programs are written
 in CWEB, a combination of TeX and C that is easy to use by anyone who knows
 those languages and easy to read by anyone familiar with the rudiments of C.
 .
 This package contains only the libraries and the demonstration programs; for

 The Linux Documentation Project advise using this set
 of SGML parsers to generate HOWTO's and books. LaTeX,
 ASCII, HTML, PostScript and roff can all be generated
 from one SGML source file.
 .
 HTML can be generated without any other Debian text
 processing package, but for the other formats the
 appropriate packages will have to be installed.
 .
 This sgml-tools has been designed and implemented only
 for linuxdoc DTD. Since the upstream completely moved away
 to the developemnt of sgmltoolls-2, this set of tools would
 not be enhanced to handle other DTD documents.
 .
 If you wish to convert debiandoc DTD documents,
 Please install and use debiandoc-sgml package.
 If you wish to convert docbook DTD documents,
 Please install and use jade or sgmltools-2 package.

Description: Second generation SGML text formatting system based on DocBook
 A text-formatting package based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
 Language), which allows you to produce TeX/DVI/PS/PDF, HTML, RTF, and
 plain ASCII (currently via Lynx) from a single source; due to the
 flexible nature of SGML many other target formats are possible.
 .
 This system is tailored for writing technical software documentation,
 an example of which are the Linux HOWTO documents. However, there is
 nothing Linux-specific about this package; it can be used for many
 other types of documentation on many other systems. It should be
 useful for all kinds of printed and online documentation.
 .
 The package was formerly called Linuxdoc-SGML because it originates
 from the Linux Documentation Project (LDP). The name has been changed
 into SGMLtools to make it clearer that there is no Linux-specific
 stuff included in this package.

 is most useful for text files containing some kind of structured text.
 A file containing structured text could be defined as a file, which
 obeys some syntax. Examples of structured text files are SGML, HTML,
 C, Tex and mail files.

 Access control lets you deny access to the server based on the senders
 envelope address or his IP address. Relay control lets you decide who
 gets to relay email through your server, based on their IP addresses.
 .
 The package was designed with the needs of large ISP's in mind, but
 is small and simple enough for anyone to use.

 number of possibilities, each with its own weighting so those really cool
 quotes can appear more often than others.  Sections can also be placed next
 to each other vertically to create columns.  Each section can be formatted
 independently as left/right/center and top/bottom/vcenter.

Description: create and render 3-d scenes
 This is SIPP, the SImple Polygon Processor, version 3.1.  SIPP is a
 library for creating 3-dimensional scenes and rendering them using a
 scan-line z-buffer algorithm.  A scene is built up of objects which
 can be transformed with rotation, translation and scaling.  The
 objects form hierarchies where each object can have arbitrarily many
 subobjects and subsurfaces.  A surface is a number of connected
 polygons which are rendered with either Phong, Gouraud or flat
 shading.  An image can also be rendered as a line drawing of the
 polygon edges without any shading at all.
 .
 The library supports texture mapping with textures in up to
 3-dimensions and automatic interpolation of texture coordinates.
 Simple anti-aliasing can be performed through oversampling.  A scene
 can be illuminated by an arbitrary number of light sources and a
 number of different lightsources are availiable.  The light from some
 of them are capable of casting shadows of objects.  A basic shading
 algorithm is provided with the library, but the user can also use his
 own shading algorithms for each surface to produce special effects.
 Objects can have varying degree of transparency, controlled by the
 shader.

Description: A program for managing a WWW site via FTP
 sitecopy is for copying locally stored websites to remote ftp servers.
 The program will upload files to the server which have changed locally,
 and delete files from the server which have been removed locally, to keep
 the remote site synchronized with the local site, with a single command.
 The aim is to remove the hassle of uploading and deleting individual files
 using an FTP client. sitecopy will also optionally try to spot files you move
 locally, and move them remotely.
 .
 sitecopy is designed to not care about what is actually on the remote
 server - it simply keeps a record of what it THINKS is in on the remote
 server, and works from that.

     possible)
   o Primitives can usually have fill and line properties:
     o Fill properties are patterns like solid colors,
       gradients, tiled images and hatching.
     o Line properties are currently a (solid) color, width,
       dashes, cap and join styles and arrow heads. Patterns
       instead of a single color are planned for the future.
   o Special Effects:
     o Blend Groups: Automatically updated interpolations of
       arbitrary objects
     o Text can be converted to bezier objects. (This works
       only if sketch has access to the PostScript Type 1
       font files (pfa or pfb)).
     o Text along a Path
   o Exports Encapsulated PostScript

Description: The GNU Eiffel Compiler
 SmallEiffel is a compiler for the Eiffel language, which is a pure
 object-oriented language providing strong type-checking and based on
 the concept of 'design by contract'.  It allows multiple inheritance
 and does it well.
 .
 Design-by-contract means that a class guarantees that certain conditions
 will always hold, and that a routine guarantees certain results
 given certain specified inputs.  The rules for inheritance mean
 that contracts can be relied on even when classes are reused through
 inheritance.
 .
 The Eiffel language is described and defined in the book "Eiffel: The
 Language" by Bertrand Meyer.

 subscribers need not be educated, unsubscribing users do not need to
 remember any particular syntax). *Intelligent* autoremoval of addresses
 from the list that cause too many bounces. * Duplicate submissions are
 eliminated automatically. * You can set up a mailinglist to function as
 a standalone mail archive server.

 Smbfs is a filesystem which understands the SMB protocol.
 This is the protocol Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT or
 Lan Manager use to talk to each other. It was inspired by
 samba, the program by Andrew Tridgell that turns any unix
 site into a file server for DOS or Windows clients.
 .
 Starting with the Debian Samba packages version 2.0.4b-2, the old smbfs
 utilities for 2.0.x and the new smbfs utilities for 2.2.x kernels have been
 merged in a single package called smbfs. A wrapper script called smbmount.sh
 identifies the version of the kernel running and calls the correct binary.

Description: Show Me The Money is a configurable Perl/Tk stock ticker program
 smtm, which is a not overly clever acronym for Show Me The Money, is a

 stock symbols, it displays these selected stocks, and also records the
 symbols for later use. When smtm is called without arguments, it reads the
 symbols tickers from a (default or specified) file. This file can be created
 explicitly by calling the Save option from the File menu, or implicitly
 whenever smtm is called with one or more symbols.
 .
 smtm display the full name of the company, the price change and the
 percentage change. Loosers are flagged in red. smtm can be used for North
 American equities, as well as European ones. It should work for other markets
 supported by Yahoo! Finance. Due to the limitated amount of information
 provided by Yahoo! UK Finance for the non-North American quotes, only the
 symbol (but not the company name) is shown. The quotes are delayed,
 typically 15 minutes for NASDAQ and 20 minutes otherwise, see Yahoo! Finance

MD5sum: 227fc28c106cfd6872d461020c493a90
Description: Simple spam-block with refusal message
 Smtp-refuser can be configured to reject mail from specific hosts
 (or that satisfy other tcpd hosts.allow or similar rules), returning a
 meaningful message including the reason it was bounced and a local phone
 number.  Because spam often has a bad envelope-from, (and because this
 is more efficient), we bounce it with an error message during the
 SMTP transaction, rather than send bounce mail later.
 .
 This SMTP refuser is used along with "tcpd" or another TCP security
 daemon to bounce messages from the IP addresses of known spammers. The
 advantage of this over just blocking the connection is that the remote
 SMTP server will not retry, and a legitimate e-mail sender will get a
 polite message telling them why their mail was blocked and whom to call
 to get around the blocking.
 .
 Other, more automated solutions such as RBL and ORBS (supported by
 most of the mail transfer agents), have become available since
 smtp-refuser was written, but this may still be of interest to you.

 in its own window, with its own cursor, edit history, and marks; each sound
 has a 'control panel' to try out various changes quickly, and an expression
 parser, used mainly during searches; there is an overall stack of 'regions'
 that can be browsed and edited; channels and sounds can be grouped together
 during editing; edits can be undone and redone without restriction
 ('unlimited undo'); Snd can be customized and extended using Gnu's Guile
 Scheme interpreter; and it's free; the code is available via anonymous ftp
 from ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu as pub/Lisp/snd.tar.gz.

Description: An extremely aggressive Scheme compiler.
 Stalin is an aggressive self-hosting Scheme compiler.  It is designed
 to generate extremely efficient stand-alone executables in terms of
 both computational performance and resource consumption.  Stalin is a
 batch mode compiler like gcc, not an interpreter.  It is designed to
 be used after your code has stabilized to dramatically improve code
 performance.
 .
 In exchange for substantial performance increases, Stalin places a
 few limitations on the content of the source code.  The chief
 limitation is that you may not not LOAD or EVAL new expressions or
 procedure definitions within a running program.  This restriction
 allows Stalin to perform various sophisticated global analyses.
 These analyses include soft, static type analysis which allows it,
 when appropriate, and without any type declarations in the source, to
 map Scheme types directly to native C types, and use native
 arithmetic operations on a per expression basis.  This analysis also
 allows Stalin to reduce, or often eliminate, run-time type checking
 and dispatching.  Stalin also does careful lifetime analysis for all
 allocated data.  This allows Stalin to completely eliminate garbage
 collection for data with limited scope or accessibility.
 .
 Stalin also performs a careful reachability analysis to eliminate any
 items from the output that are inaccessible.
 .
 Stalin has a foreign procedure interface to both Xlib and OpenGL.

Description: Software Upgrade Protocol implementation
 The SUP System is a set of programs developed by Carnegie Mellon
 University that provide for collections of files to be maintained in
 identical versions across a number of machines.  These programs are:
 .
 SUP: The "client" program, run by users or system maintainers, which
 initiates the upgrade activity  on  a  machine  requesting  the
 latest  version of a collection of files.  SUP will normally be
 run as a daemon, firing up once  each  night  (week,  etc.)  to
 upgrade the specified file collections.
 .
 SUPFILESRV: The "file server" program, a daemon that is run by the
 system maintainer to service requests for files initiated by client
 SUP programs.  The file server runs on every machine used as a
 "repository" of distributable versions of files.  It runs continuously
 and listens for network connection requests by individual client
 processes; for each individual client request, a process is forked to
 service that request.
 .
 SUPSCAN: The "file scanner" program, that may optionally be run
 periodically to speed up execution of the file server.  It
 pre-compiles a list of files on the file system that match the
 specifications for a given file collection so that the file server
 need not do this during each upgrade of that collection.  The file
 scanner is normally used daily for very large file collections that
 are upgraded by many clients each day; it is not so useful for small
 file collections or for those that are upgraded by only a few client
 machines per day.

 one which does not access the physical display hardware directly.
 Instead, SVGAlib's interface is implemented via calls to LibGGI.
 Using this library, you can run SVGAlib applications on any display
 target supported by LibGGI (except the real SVGAlib itself).
 .
 You should not attempt to compile SVGAlib applications against this
 wrapper library.  Install svgalibg1-dev or svgalib-dummyg1 for this.

Description: Run higher resolution text modes.
 This program is designed to greatly improve the normal
 (EGA-based) textmodes on your Linux machine. It uses an Xconfig-like
 configuration file to set up better looking textmodes. (=higher resolution,
 larger font size, higher display refresh...) This is already a big boon on
 normal 14" displays, and it is an immense difference on larger and better
 (15" and up) screens.
 .
 It stems from the idea that it is a real waste of hardware to use EGA
 textmodes on an SVGA-card, which was designed to do much better than that.
 .
 You will need the `console-tools' package if you use screen sizes with a
 character height different from the default.
 .
 WARNING: This program will not work on non-VGA based systems.  Installing it
 will not do any harm, but activating the program can.

Description: Virtual network computing client software for SVGA.
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `Desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 It is implemented in a client/server model. This package provides a client
 for SVGA, with this you can connect to a vncserver somewhere in the network
 and display its content on a graphic capable console. There are vncserver
 available for X and for Win95/NT, although the Win95/NT server may not work
 with svgalib viewer due to missing palette handling.

Description: Prolog interpreter.
 SWI-Prolog is a Prolog implementation based on a subset of the WAM.
 SWI-Prolog has been designed and implemented such that it can easily be
 modified for experiments with logic programming and the relation
 between logic programming and other programming paradigms (such as the
 object oriented XPCE environment).  SWI-Prolog has a rich set of
 built-in predicates and reasonable performance, which makes it possible
 to develop substantial applications in it.  The current version offers
 a module system, garbage collection and an interface to the C language.

Description: Python script development environment
 Packages that allow you to develop scripts and and simple applications
 in Python.
 .
 Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language.  It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.
 .
 Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has
 modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and
 dynamic typing.  There are interfaces to many system calls and
 libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
 Mac, MFC).  New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++.
 Python is also usable as an extension language for applications that
 need a programmable interface.
 .
 You may also want to install one of the following editing environments,
 each of which has support for Python syntax highlighting:
     python-elisp (with any of the emacsen)
     vim-python
     nedit
 .
 Overview of the task-python packages
 .
   Install:            if you want to:
   -------             ---------------
   task-python         write scripts and uncomplicated Python applications
   task-python-web     write CGI scripts and web applications in Python
   task-python-bundle  have the entire upstream (www.python.org) distribution
   task-python-dev     write complex Python applications, have available
                         most of the Debian-packaged Python extensions, and/or
                         write Python extensions in other programming languages
 .
 (Note that you needn't install any of these to be able to use
 other packages that are written in Python; the required pieces
 will be automatically installed along with the packages that need
 them.
 .
 You may later remove these task-* packages without losing
 anything else.)

 support and development packages for libc5-based X clients and the static
 versions of the X libraries (which are very large and typically used only by
 X client developers debugging their programs).
 .
 Note that machines with limited amounts of free disk space should not select
 this task (it may consume 40-65 megabytes); if X is needed, it is better to

 libraries, an X server, a set of fonts (for Western languages only), and a
 group of basic X clients and utilities.
 .
 Alpha, i386, and SPARC users should note that the X server depended upon is
 the one most likely to work given the majority of hardware used on these
 architectures; individual circumstances will vary, however.
 .
 Higher level metapackages, such as those for desktop environments, can depend
 on this package and simplify their dependencies.
 .
 It should be noted that a package providing x-window-manager and a package
 providing x-terminal-emulator should also be installed to ensure a
 comfortable X experience.

Description: A lexical analyzer generator for Tcl
 tcLex is a lexer (lexical analyzer) generator extension to Tcl. It is
 inspired by Unix and GNU lex and flex, which are "tools for
 generating programs that perform pattern-matching on text". tcLex is
 very similar to these programs, except it uses Tcl philosophy and
 syntax, whereas the others use their own syntax and are used in
 conjunction with the C language. People used to lex or flex should
 then feel familiar with tcLex. tcLex is a small extension (the
 Windows compiled version is about 20kb, and the source is about
 150kb), because it extensively uses the Tcl library. However, the
 current doesn't use Tcl's regexp code anymore but a patched version
 is now included in tcLex, which makes it slightly bigger (by a few
 KB). tcLex should work with Tcl 8.0 and later.  tcLex will NEVER work
 with earlier versions, because it uses Tcl 8.0's "object" system for
 performance. The most interesting features are:
 .
  * cross-platform support, thanks to Tcl. Though it has been
    developped on Windows and tested on Windows and Unix only, it
    should work on other platforms as long as Tcl exists on these
    platforms. Supported Tcl platforms are Windows 95/NT, Unix (Linux,
    Solaris...) and Macintosh. Other platforms are VMS, OS/2,
    NeXTStep, Amiga...
 .
  * unlike lex and flex, which only generate static lexers written in
    C and intended to be compiled, tcLex dynamically generates Tcl
    commands that can be used like other C commands or Tcl procedures
    from within Tcl scripts or C programs.
 .
  * it uses Tcl regular expressions. That means you don't have to
    learn another regexp language.
 .
  * it works with Tcl namespaces
 .
  * the generated lexer commands can be used in one pass or
    incrementally, because they maintain state information. That way,
    several instances of the same lexer (eg a HTML parser) can run at
    the same time in distinct call frames and maintain distinct states
    (local variables...). Lexer need not be specially designed in
    order to be used incrementally, the same lexer can transparently
    be used in one pass or incrementally. This feature is especially
    useful when processing text from a file or an Internet socket (Web
    pages for example), when data is not necessarily available at the
    beginning of the processing.

Description: Compatibility package for old termcap-based programs.
 The termcap-compat package provides the libtermcap.so.2 and /etc/termcap
 files which are required to run non-Debian, binary-only termcap-based
 programs. Since libc6-based programs are hopefully "modern" enough to be
 linked with ncurses (or slang), this package only provides a libc5-based
 libtermcap library.
 .
 You do not need to install this package to run Debian-packaged programs
 since Debian GNU/Linux uses terminfo and not termcap. You need this
 package if a program (that you cannot recompile) fails to run with
 the error message "...: can't load library 'libtermcap.so.2'" or complains
 about a missing /etc/termcap file.
 .
 The termcap-compat package isn't meant to be used to compile programs
 therefore it doesn't provide all the necessary files for compilation. If you
 want to compile a program that claims to need termcap, why not try
 ncurses's termcap emulation instead? It's as simple as linking with ncurses
 instead of libtermcap (i.e. replace the '-ltermcap' with '-lncurses' in
 the makefile). Ncurses' termcap emulation routines translate terminfo entries
 to termcap entries on the fly, so you don't even need an /etc/termcap file.
 .

  libtermcap.so shared library, version 2.0.8

Description: LaTeX and TeX for Hypertext (HTML)
 TeX4ht is a highly configurable TeX-based authoring system for producing
 hypertext. It interacts with TeX-based applications through style files and
 postprocessors, leaving the processing of the source files to the native TeX
 compiler. Consequently, TeX4ht can handle the features of TeX-based systems
 in general, and of LaTeX in particular.
 .
 TeX4ht can be used both for authoring HTML using TeX/LaTeX input files, or
 for converting existing TeX input files (in any format) into HTML, with
 (usually) only minor modifications.
 .
 You will need imagemagick suite of programs to convert from graphics in DVI
 files, as output by TeX (via postscript) to GIF or JPEG files.
 Alternatively, you could use ghostscript and programs from the netpbm package
 after adjusting TeX4ht's configuration.

 Macintosh clients. However, TiK now has most of the features the native
 clients have, plus some extras. TiK includes a graphical buddy list display
 plus packages for away messages, buddy pounce, buddy ticker, and im
 capturing. It is very easy for end users to add new features to TiK, using
 Tcl/Tk. TiK is meant to give UNIX users an alternative to the Java client.

Description: System for processing phonetic symbols in LaTeX
 TIPA is a system for processing IPA (International Phonetic
 Alphabet) symbols in LaTeX written by Fukui Rei.  TIPA stands for
 either TeX IPA or Tokyo IPA and derived from the tsipa package, made
 in 1992 by Kobayashi Hajime, Fukui Rei and Shirakawa Shun.  Its
 primary distribution site is
 ftp://tooyoo.L.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pub/TeX/tipa.
 .
 Among many features of TIPA, the following are the new features as
 compared with tsipa or any other existing systems for processing IPA
 symbols:
 .
   * A new 256 character encoding for phonetic symbols (`T3'), which
     includes all the symbols and diacritics found in the recent
     versions of IPA and some non-IPA symbols.
   * Complete support of LaTeX2e.
   * Roman, slanted, bold, bold extended and sans serif font styles.
   * Easy input method in the IPA environment.
   * Extended macros for accents and diacritics.
   * A flexible system of macros for `tone letters'.
   * An optional package (vowel.sty) for drawing vowel diagrams.
   * A slightly modified set of fonts that go well when used with
     Times Roman and Helvetica fonts.
 .
 There is another package called tipa-type1 which contains the PostScript
 type 1 fonts for TIPA.

Description: Cleans up files in directories based on their age
 This package provides a program that can be used to clean out temporary-file
 directories.  It recursively searches the directory, refusing to chdir()
 across symlinks, and removes files that haven't been accessed in a
 user-specified amount of time.  You can specify a set of files to protect
 from deletion with a shell pattern.  It will not remove files owned by the
 process EUID that have the `w' bit clear, unless you ask it to, much like
 `rm -f'.  `tmpreaper' will not remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special
 files unless given a command line option enabling it to.
 .
 WARNING:  Please do not run `tmpreaper' on `/'.  There are no protections
 against this written into the program, as that would prevent it from
 functioning the way you'd expect it to in a `chroot(8)' environment.

 driver for the making and maintaining of backups.  It makes full
 backups, differential backups (of the files which were changed since
 the last full backup), incremental backups (of files changed since all
 previous backups), lets you determine the size of the backup before
 actually making it, maintain listings of made backups, make remote
 backups and possibly more.

Description: LBNL audio conferencing tool over the internet.
 The LBNL audio tool, vat, is a real-time, multi-party, multimedia
 application for audio conferencing over the Internet. Vat is based on
 the Draft Internet Standard Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
 developed by the IETF Audio/Video Transport working group. RTP is an
 application-level protocol implemented entirely within vat -- you need
 no special system enhancements to run RTP. Although vat can be run
 point-to-point using standard unicast IP addresses, it is primarily
 intended as a multiparty conferencing application. To make use of the
 conferencing capabilities, your system must support IP Multicast, and
 ideally, your network should be connected to the IP Multicast Backbone
 (MBone).
 .
 Vat provides only the audio portion of a multimedia conference; video,
 whiteboard, and session control tools are implemented as separate
 applications. Our video tool is called vic and our whiteboard tool wb,
 UCL developed the session directory tool sdr Other related
 applications include ISI's Multimedia Conference Control, mmcc, the
 Xerox PARC Network Video tool, nv and the INRIA Video-conferencing
 System, ivs.

 more advanced commands that do tasks like bursting and creating
 digests, message forwarding, and organizing message presentation
 according to various criteria.
 .
 It should also be mentioned here that the documentation for vm is woefully
 behind the times; there fore we include /usr/doc/vm/vm-vars.el.gz, which
 has information about all customizable variables in vm. Also, VM 6.x
 versions have problems with the library tm-vm from the Tiny Mime (TM)

Description: Verify electronic mail addresses.
 'vrfy' is a tool to verify e-mail addresses and mailing lists.  In its
 simplest form it takes an address "user@domain", figures out the MX hosts
 for "domain", and issues the SMTP command VRFY at the primary MX host
 (optionally all), or at "domain" itself if no MX hosts exist.  Without
 "domain" it goes to "localhost".
 .
 More complex capabilities are:
  * recursively expanding forward files or mailing lists,
  * detecting mail forwarding loops,
  * understanding full-blown RFC822 address specifications,
  * syntax checking that can be carried out either locally or remotely,
  * various options provided to exploit alternative protocol suites
    if necessary, and to print many forms of verbose output.
 .
 Obvious limitations exist (mostly due to a lousy VRFY command
 implementation on some hosts), but otherwise, it works pretty well.

Description: Display laptop battery info, dockable in Windowmaker
 Wmbattery displays the status of your laptop's battery in a small icon.
 This includes if it is plugged in, if the battery is charging, how many
 minutes of battery life remain, battery life remaining (with both a
 percentage and a graph), and battery status (high - green, low - yellow,
 or critical - red).
 .
 There's nothing in the program that makes it require WindowMaker, except
 maybe the look. It can be docked in WindowMaker or Afterstep's dock.
 .
 To use this program you need to enable APM support for your kernel during
 configuration; the corresponding questions are in the 'Character devices'
 section. It will only work on laptops with an APM BIOS.

Description: Keep Track of Time worked on Projects
 From the author:
 Worklog is a program that helps you keep track of your time.  I wrote
 this program because I have several projects that require me to keep a
 timesheet.  I sometimes spend 5 minutes here and there doing
 miscellaneous administrative tasks.  Rather than invoke an editor on a
 timesheet file for every little segment of my time spent doing these
 tasks, I wanted to leave a clock running and indicate with one or two
 keystrokes the onset or change of any given task.  Worklog is a simple
 ncurses based program to do just that.

Description: Operate X-10 electrical power control modules.
 X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet
 and allow you to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that
 is plugged into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of
 wall switches to control lights, and there's one that can be used to set
 back a thermostat.
 .
 This program commands up to 256 X-10 modules via a
 CP-290 serial-interface controller plugged into any serial port of your
 system. You can use it to automate your home!
 It's also commonly used to provide control over computers and other devices
 that might need to be powered up or down via a timed command or remote
 control. The CP-290 controller stores 128 clock-driven events that it will
 execute when your computer is turned off, so you can even program your
 computer to turn itself on at a particular time.
 .
 You can buy the modules and manual controllers in Radio Shack stores,
 but the CP-290 serial-interface controller used to command them using your
 Debian system is slightly harder to find. Instructions on where to order
 one are included in the documentation of this package.

Description: Link two X displays together, simulating a multiheaded display
 x2x joins a pair of X displays together, as if they were a single
 multiheaded display.  The pointer can be warped between displays,
 or, depending on how you start x2x, can slide from one display to the
 other when it runs off the edge of the screen.  Keyboard focus also
 moves between displays in the way you'd expect, and the X selection
 propagates around.  At least one of the displays involved (specifically,
 the one being controlled remotely) must support the XTEST extension.
 (The servers shipped by Debian support this.)
 .
 x2x is useful when you have two displays on the same desk, as you can use
 a single keyboard and mouse to control both.  If you want to propagate
 your selections between displays which are not sharing a desk, you might
 be more interested in the package propsel.  Propsel does not link the
 displays' keyboard and mouse, which would be confusing in some cases,
 and can propagate between up to 8 displays, whereas x2x can handle only
 two at a time.

Description: XFree86 upgrade convenience package
 Between Debian 2.0 ("hamm") and 2.1 ("slink") the XFree86 packages were
 extensively reorganized; this package exists solely to smooth the transition
 for people upgrading from Debian 2.0 or earlier.  Those whose have fresh
 installations of Debian 2.1 or later have no need of this package.
 .
 Once this package has been installed it may be removed at any time; it
 contains no programs, libraries, or documentation.
 .
 For the technically curious, this package exists solely to declare
 dependencies on the packages among whom the old xbase package's files were
 distributed.  The new packages are auto-selected by apt or dselect as a
 result, and the X Window System is properly upgraded.
 .
 Additionally, the X font and static library packages have been renamed.  For
 more information see the /usr/doc/xbase/README.Debian file in this package or
 /usr/doc/xfree86-common/README.Debian-upgrade in the xfree86-common package.

Description: miscellaneous X clients
 An X client is a program that uses the X libraries to interface with an X
 server, and thus with some input and output hardware like a graphics card,
 monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of X clients that ship with
 the X Window System, including:
  * xinit and startx, the programs that start an X session on demand from the
    command line;
  * a bitmap editor and conversion utilities;
  * utilities for font display and format conversion;
  * beforelight, a rudimentary screensaver;
  * X resource display and editing utilities;
  * X server testing and performance evaluation programs;
  * graphical clocks (xclock and oclock);
  * X session access control programs;
  * tools for use with the XKEYBOARD (XKB) extension;
  * xmodmap, a tool for remapping keys and pointer buttons;
  * xvidtune, a video mode tuner for XFree86 X servers;
  * a screen/window capture program, xwd (and viewer for the captures, xwud);
 and several other programs of general utility in the X Window System.
 .
 xbase-clients depends on cpp because xrdb requires it; the conflicts,
 replaces, and provides are due to package reorganizations and to ensure
 up-to-date support mechanisms for xaw-wrappers and X font packages.

Description: A concurrent multi-player battle strategy game.
 xbattle is a concurrent multi-player game which combines elements of
 strategy with arcade-like action to capture a wide range of military
 scenarios.  Opponents play from separate displays, with commands being
 executed concurrently -- the players do not take "turns", but rather they
 all issue their commands simultaneously.  There can be any number of
 players, with each player assigned to a specific team, indicated by marker
 colors.  The game board is a matrix of cells (square, hexes, etc.) that can
 be occupied by colored troops, with the goal of the game being to eliminate
 the enemy from the board by attacking cells occupied by enemy troops.  A
 wide variety of command line options (and previously configured game files)
 provide an abundance of different scenarios and gaming environments.

Description: Editor and kitchen sink -- support binaries
 A spinoff of the GNU Emacs editor with much better support for X
 including multiple fonts within the same buffer and images within
 buffers, but that doesn't even begin to describe the changes.
 .
 XEmacs is a full fledged programming language with a mail reader,
 news reader, info browser, web browser, calendar, specialized editor
 for more programming languages and other formats than most people
 encounter in a lifetime, and much much more.
 .
 After starting it up peruse the Help menu and read more on its
 origins and what it can do.
 .
 You will need one of xemacs21-mule, xemacs21-nomule, or
 xemacs21-mule-canna-wnn to actually run xemacs.

 for entering non-European characters (see the xemacs21-mule-canna-wnn
 package for that).

 following input devices:
   * joystick (PC gameport type)
   * Elographics touchscreen
   * MicroTouch touchscreens (using stylus or finger)

 calibration program), and are using a Linux kernel version prior to 2.2, you
 will need the joystick kernel module package.  The joystick extension is not
 available in the m68k version of this package.

Description: X server configuration tools
 xf86setup contains two X clients used to configure XFree86 X servers.
 .
 XF86Setup itself is used to either perform the initial setup of the servers
 or to make adjustments to the existing configuration; when invoked from the
 console to initially configure the XFree86 servers, it will start the VGA16
 server and then allow configuration settings to be entered.  When run from
 within an already running server environment (e.g. from an xterm window),
 XF86Setup can be used to make adjustments to the current server
 configuration.
 .
 Again, if you wish to use the XF86Setup program to perform initial
 configuration of the X server (i.e., you do not have a working XF86Config
 file), you MUST have the xserver-vga16 package installed.
 .
 xf86setup also contains a graphical mouse configuration utility, xmseconfig.
 .
 Note to Alpha users: The XF86Setup program has no awareness of TGA
 hardware and cannot be used to configure the TGA server.  Because the VGA16
 server does not work on the Alpha, XF86Setup can only be used to adjust an
 existing X server configuration on that architecture.

Description: Displays an image for each piece of mail in your mailbox.
 XFaces is a program that will display an image for each
 piece of mail in your mail box. This lets you know at a
 glance who you have mail from. XFaces starts out (when you
 have no mail) looking like a color xbiff. As you receive
 mail XFaces becomes a column of mail images. Some of XFaces
 features:
 .
 - Both mono and color images.
 .
 - Optional Shaped window support with both xpm and xbm.
 .
 - Sound support using the NetAudio protocol. The NetAudio server
 currently supports Sun's SparcStation (SunOS 4.1.X and Solaris 2.2),
 SGI's Indigo and NCD MCX X terminals running NCDware 3.1 or later.
 .
 - Face images can be "compressed" so that each image will only
 show up once on your display. This way, if you receive 30 messages
 from one user, list or whatever the image will only show up once.
 .
 - You can use regular expressions to search any headers to choose
 images and sounds or ignore that mail message completely. This
 lets you specify an image/sound for mail that comes from a
 mailing list or ignore mail that you have already seen but
 left in your system mailbox.
 .
 - Compatibility support for Rich Burridge's faces program. This
 includes the ability to run user command to generate the image
 list.
 .
 - Support for POP mailboxes.
 .
 - XFaces can kick off shell commands based upon mailbox
 contents.  You could have yourself paged when a high priority
 item needs your attention.
 .
 - XFaces can run external filters to convert images into Xpm
 so that image formats that XFaces does not understand can
 be used.
 .
 - The annotations for mail items include username, hostname,
 count, user@host, the contents of any header.

Description: X Window System (XFree86) infrastructure
 xfree86-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration.
 .
 Those wishing an X server only (with remote font services and clients) will
 also require the xserver-common package and an X server package.
 .
 The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries
 (the xlib6g package), xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages,
 and likely many more client packages.
 .
 Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are fuzzy on the concepts
 of X servers and X clients) will require both of the above sets of packages.
 A recommended minimal list of packages for such a configuration is:
 xbase-clients, xf86setup, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, xfonts-base,
 xfonts-scalable, xlib6g, xserver-common, an xserver (several are available,
 and which you use is largely dependent on your graphics hardware), a window
 manager (several are available, and which you use is largely a matter of
 preference), and a terminal emulator X client package (again, several are
 available and which you use is your decision).
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X
 Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R6.3".  The version of X used in Debian
 is derived from the version released by the XFree86 Project, Inc., and is
 thus often also referred to as "XFree86".  All of the preceding quoted terms
 are functionally interchangeable in a Debian system.
 .
 Still confused?  Install this package and then read the files in
 /usr/doc/xfree86-common/ for assistance.

 libraries communicate with X servers by means of the X protocol.  Xlib itself
 provides the low-level functionality; Xt, the X Toolkit Instrinsics, is often
 used as a foundation for widget libraries such as Lesstif or Athena.  Xaw,
 the Athena widget set, provides a rudimentary set of graphical user-interface

 is apparently possible with xbiff if you tweak the resources. By tweaking

Description: Graphical Resource Organizer Kit
 xmbase-grok, formerly just called "grok", is a simple database manager
 and UI builder that can -
 .
   *  keep phone and address lists (like a rolodex)
   *  store phone call logs
   *  keep todo lists
   *  manage any other database after simple GUI-driven customization
   *  customized data export, HTML export built in
 .
 More precisely, grok is a program for displaying and editing strings
 arranged in a grid of rows and columns. Each row is presented as a "card"
 consisting of multiple columns, or "fields", that allow data entry. The
 presentation of the data is programmable; a user interface builder that
 allows the user to arrange fields on a card graphically is part of grok.
 Grok also supports a simple language that allows sophisticated queries
 and data retrieval. Grok comes with the above examples and a few others
 as pre-built applications.
 .
 Grok is not a general-purpose database program. It was designed for small
 applications typical for desktop accessories. If you attempt to run your
 major airline reservation system or your space shuttle project with it,
 you are guaranteed to be disappointed.

Description: X proxy services
 xproxy provides a low bandwidth X proxy (lbxproxy), an X firewall proxy
 (xfwp), and a proxy manager service (proxymngr).
 .
 lbxproxy is useful for running X clients across a slow network connection.
 Applications need not know anything about the Low Bandwidth extension to X
 (LBX); they simply connect to lbxproxy as if it were another server.  The
 proxy accepts client connections, multiplexes them over a single connection
 to the X server, and performs various optimizations on the X protocol to make
 it faster over low bandwidth and/or high latency connections.
 .
 xfwp is an application layer gateway proxy that may be run on a network
 firewall host to forward X traffic across the firewall.
 .
 proxymngr is responsible for resolving requests from xfindproxy (in the
 xbase-clients package) and other similar clients, starting new proxies when
 appropriate, and keeping track of all the available proxy services.

 Scavenger is like Lode Runner. You've got to run around gathering objects
 while avoiding enemies. You can dig down through some of the blocks to get
 at buried objects. After you've collected everything, ladders may appear.
 To finish the level you've got to exit through the top of the screen. If
 an enemy falls into a dug brick, he is stunned for a while. If the brick
 fills in with him in it, he is killed, and he will reappear at the top of
 the screen.

 xautolock programs is the ease with which new graphics hacks can be
 installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a new display
 mode, you just change some resource settings.  Any program which can be
 invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen can
 now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
 are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge
 about what it means to be a screensaver.

Description: files and utilities common to all X servers
 The X server is the hardware interface of the X Window System.  Its job is to
 communicate with video display and input devices, and present them in a
 standardized, abstract fashion via the X protocol to X clients (X-based
 programs).  The X server largely relieves programs of having to know or care
 about the details of the hardware with which they are interacting (such
 things as 32-bit versus 8-bit color, the layout of the keyboard, how many
 buttons the mouse has, etc.).  The catch is that the X server must itself
 know the technical specifications of the graphics hardware and monitor, the
 keyboard layout, the protocol used by the mouse, and so forth.
 .
 Most of the X servers in Debian are authored by the XFree86 Project, Inc.,
 which also distributes the rest of the X Window System source code for
 convenience.  XFree86's X servers attempt where possible to take advantage of
 acceleration features present within the video hardware.
 .
 xserver-common contains files required by all XFree86 X servers, and includes
 a text-based program (xf86config) that configures the /etc/X11/XF86Config
 file, whose primary purpose is to describe the computer's video and input
 hardware to the X server.
 .
 All X servers either need fonts installed on the local host, or need to know
 of a remote host that provides font services (with xfs, for instance).  The
 former means that font packages are mandatory.  The latter means that font
 packages may be gratuitous.  To err on the side of caution, install at least

Description: X server for framebuffer-based graphics drivers
 xserver-fbdev is an X server that uses the kernel-based framebuffer device
 driver for display.
 .
 To use this server, you must have a kernel that supports the framebuffer
 console device.  For the Alpha and i386 architectures, this capability is
 absent from the 2.0 (and earlier) kernel series.  Users of these
 architectures must use version 2.2 or later of the Linux kernel with support
 for an appropriate framebuffer console driver to employ this X server.

Description: X server for all LibGGI targets
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains XGGI, a unified X server for all GGI targets.
 This server draws to the screen by calling LibGGI, and therefore
 takes advantage of LibGGI's range of available targets and hardware
 acceleration.
 .
 IMPORTANT: Be sure to read at least the keyboard section in the README
 before attempting to run XGGI!
 .
 WARNING: If you select XGGI to be your default X server, be prepared
 for some breakage.  XGGI may not accept all the command-line options
 of the XFree86 X servers (although it does support -bpp), and does not
 use the /etc/X11/XF86Config configuration file.

Description: A program for managing a WWW site via FTP (GNOME version)
 sitecopy is for copying locally stored websites to remote ftp servers.
 The program will upload files to the server which have changed locally,
 and delete files from the server which have been removed locally, to keep
 the remote site synchronized with the local site, with a single command.
 The aim is to remove the hassle of uploading and deleting individual files
 using an FTP client. sitecopy will also optionally try to spot files you move
 locally, and move them remotely.
 .
 sitecopy is designed to not care about what is actually on the remote
 server - it simply keeps a record of what it THINKS is in on the remote
 server, and works from that.
 .
 This version is the GNOME frontend to sitecopy.

Description: X session manager
 A session is a group of applications, each of which has a particular state.
 xsm allows you to create arbitrary sessions -- for example, you might have a
 "light" session, a "development" session, or an "xterminal" session.  Each
 session can have its own set of applications.  Within a session, you can
 perform a "checkpoint" to save application state, or a "shutdown" to save
 state and exit the session.  When you log back in to the system, you can load
 a specific session, and you can delete sessions you no longer want to keep.
 .
 Many window managers and desktop environments for X also provide session
 management services; this is the original X Consortium reference
 implementation.

Description: Fast 48k ZX Spectrum Emulator for X11
 Xspect is the X11 version of Spectemu which emulates the 48k ZX Spectrum, which uses the Z80 microprocessor.
 .
 It emulates the Z80 processor as well as the 48k Spectrum's other
 hardware: keyboard, screen, sound, tape I/O. The emulation is very
 close to the real thing, but it is still quite fast (It was reported
 to be working well on a laptop with 486 at 25Mhz!). On the other hand,
 the user interface is not the best.
 .
 Features include:
    - Sound support through Linux kernel sound-card driver.
    - Snapshot saving and loading (.Z80 and .SNA format)
    - Tape emulation: loading from tape files (.TAP and .TZX format)
    - Optional quick loading of tapes.
    - Saving to tape files.
    - Separate utility to save tape files to real tape
    - Configurable with config files and from command line

Description: provides tide and current predictions
 XTide is a package that provides tide and current predictions in a wide
 variety of formats. Graphs, text listings, and calendars can be generated,
 or a tide clock can be provided on your desktop.
 .
 XTide can work with the X window system, plain text terminals, or the
 web. This is accomplished with three separate programs: the interactive
 interface (xtide), the non-interactive or command line interface (tide),
 and the web interface (xttpd).
 .
 The algorithm that XTide uses to predict tides is the one used by the
 National Ocean Service in the U.S. It is significantly more accurate than
 the simple tide clocks that can be bought in novelty stores. However, it
 takes more to predict tides accurately than just a spiffy algorithm -- you
 also need data for every location for which you want to predict tides.
 XTide reads this data from harmonics files that are installed with the
 Debian package.

Description: virtual framebuffer X server
 xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices.  It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory.  The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package should not be confused with xserver-fbdev, the X server that
 interfaces with the kernel's framebuffer device; this package, xvfb, does not
 use the video hardware and is not a "real" X server in the popular sense.

MD5sum: be7b97ed98bde8a505fb87228ef5ca4f
Description: X terminal-emulator similar to xterm, but smaller
 xvt is an X terminal-emulator that is designed to be more or less
 compatible with xterm while using much less swap space.  It is mainly
 intended for use at sites which use large numbers of X terminals but
 may also be useful on single workstations that are short of memory.
 The main way that xvt achieves its small size is by avoiding the use
 of the X toolkit.
 .
 If you are looking for a more featureful terminal-emulator than xvt,
 but one which still uses less swap space than xterm, consider rxvt.
 .
 Features of xterm which xvt does not support include:
 .
  - Tektronix 4014 emulation
  - Session logging
  - Pop-up menus.  The only one of xterm's popup menu commands that
    is provided in xvt is displaying and hiding of the scrollbar
    and this is done simply by pressing any mouse key in the window
    with the CONTROL key held down.
  - Toolkit style configurability.  In particular, xvt does not
    allow the user to remap the mouse or keyboard keys.
 .
 Features which are supported include:
 .
  - VT100 emulation.  Most of the main escape sequences are supported --
    certainly all those used by the standard screen based UNIX
    applications.
  - Lines that scroll off the top of the window are saved and can be
    scrolled back with a scrollbar.
  - Text selection and insertion including double and triple click for
    words and lines.

 program exists to do so on those rare occasions when you could really
 use it.  xwit will also resize, iconify, pop, and move windows given

 going, and change individual key autorepeat settings, etc.

Description: Programming environment and editor for console and X11
 Xwpe is an integrated programming and debugging environment similar to
 Borland's Turbo C and Pascal family. It has many features including
 the ability to start many compilers, linkers and debuggers from a
 menu-based interface or using keystrokes.
 .
 Syntax highlighting is included for many programming languages, and
 any compiler and debugger can easily be used by the program. When
 compiling from within xwpe, errors in the source code can be jumped to
 and swiftly corrected. Variables and the stack can be easily displayed.
 Setting and unsetting breakpoints can be done directly within the
 source code.
 .
 Although it is designed to be a tool for programmers (when invoked as
 wpe or xwpe), it can also be used as an easy to learn text editor
 (when invoked as we or xwe).

 you to take care of a lot of detail but on the flip side allows
 you to control very precisely what you are doing. In
 addition, it has many advanced functions that DEU didn't

 image plus about 2.4 meg of utilities on a single floppy.  Yard is
 also useful for creating self-contained Linux-on-a-floppy systems.
 You specify a basic set of files and utilities for inclusion and
 Yard handles many of the details.  Features:
  - File specs allow absolute and relative filenames, symbolic links,
    file replacements and full shell-style globbing.
  - Automatically determines necessary libraries and loaders.
  - Allows stripping of binaries and libraries during copying.
  - Automatically regenerates ld.so.cache
  - Checks for broken symlinks
  - Checks /etc/{fstab,inittab,termcap,pam.conf} for common errors and
    inconsistencies.
  - Checks user directories and files mentioned in /etc/passwd
  - Checks command files (eg, rc.local and .login) and scripts for
    missing binaries and command interpreters.
  - Automatically performs filesystem compression and copying.
  - Can be used with or without LILO.
  - Can make single or double disk sets.
  - Extensive checking of user choices and execution errors.

Description: A small freeware Forth environment in ANSI C.
 yForth? is an interestingly small implementation of Forth for Linux.  It
 suffers several deficiencies, not the least of which is that it won't work
 on 64 bit processors.  For general Forth programming or learning under Linux,
 yForth? is not the best choice.
 .
 From the author's README:
 .
 yForth? is a Forth environment written entirely in ANSI C, making it
 extremely portable. The first thing I want to tell you about yForth? is

 Nevertheless, you could find yForth? nice, in which case you're invited to

Description: Yet oneOther Document Language.
 Yodl is a package that implements a pre-document language and tools to
 process it.  The idea of Yodl is that you write up a document in a
 pre-language, then use the tools (e.g. yodl2html) to convert it to some
 final document language.  Current converters are for HTML, ms, man, LaTeX
 SGML and texinfo, plus a poor-man's text converter.  Main document types are
 "article", "report", "book" and "manpage".  The Yodl document language is
 designed to be easy to use and extensible.

 You can display binary CGMs to X, and write PostScript or CGM output.
 Gist is tuned to work best with Yorick-generated CGMs.  Since CGM is
 not a page description (PostScript is), non-Yorick CGMs may not display
 exactly as intended.  In general, you should avoid CGMs for this reason.

 Youbin is a kind of biff in the network age. When youbin is used, the
 mail spool of a certain, specific machine (mail server) is observed to
 inform the arrival of mail to a user at an arbitrary machine through
 the network.  On the other hand, the conventional "biff" informs only
 the user who logs in at the machine with the mail spool. Combining
 with POP, youbin eliminate a lot of NFS mount of mail spool for mail
 arrival checking.
 .
 Since youbin is designed with event driven, the user is promptly
 informed of status change of mail spool caused by mail arriving and
 reading.

 A modern hard drive will have more sectors in the outer tracks because they
 are longer.  The hard drive will have a number (often more than 8) of zones
 where each zone has the same number of sectors (due to the need for an
 integral number of sectors per track).  This program allows you to determine
 the levels of performance provided by different zones and store them in a
 conveniant format for gnuplot.
 It's also good for trivial tasks like determining whether you have a 10x or a
 20x CD-ROM drive.  ;)

Description: "Zile is a lossy emacs" a very small emacs-like editor
 Zile is another Emacs-clone. Zile is an extensible, customizable,
 self-documenting real-time display editor. Zile was written  with
 "Emacs-cloning" in mind: every Emacs user should feel at home with
 Zile.
 .
 Zile should really appear like Emacs, but a lot of ideas were also
 taken from from other editors:
  * Emacs: General look-n-feel, function names, function behaviors,
    key bindings.
  * XEmacs: Some minor hints for look-n-feel.
  * Jed: Mini help window, mode line.
  * ce: Structure names, function names.

Description: Mailer for Extreme Performance Demands
 This is a package that implements an internet Message Transfer Agent
 called ZMailer.  It is intended for gateways or mail servers or other
 large site environments that have extreme demands on the abilities of
 the mailer.  It was motivated by the problems of the Sendmail design
 in such situations. ZMailer is one of the mailers able to deal with
 huge quantities of mail and is more efficient any other mailer, qmail
 included, mostly due to its excellent queueing algorithms.
 .
 Most users don't need this package -- for most users, sendmail or exim or
 smail will suffice.

 to publish the Zope object 'silly-walks/current' instead of just
 'current'.
 .
 SiteAccess provides the ability to force ZPublisher to call objects
 of your choice as it enters any folder. With this capability, you can
 designate a method in the Zope root to examine the request parameters
 and alter or replace the URL.
