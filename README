This directory contains the source code for the Setup program
for the Cygwin net releases.

HOW TO BUILD:
-------------

Cygwin
------

Setup should build out-of-the-box on any Cygwin environment that has all the
required packages and their dependencies installed:

  - autoconf
  - automake
  - bison
  - flex
  - libtool
  - make
  - mingw64-${arch}-bzip2
  - mingw64-${arch}-gcc-g++
  - mingw64-${arch}-headers
  - mingw64-${arch}-libgcrypt
  - mingw64-${arch}-libsolv
  - mingw64-${arch}-xz
  - mingw64-${arch}-zlib
  - mingw64-${arch}-zstd
  - upx (optional)

The ${arch} needs to be replaced with either "i686" or "x86_64"
depending on the target architecture to build for.

Fedora
------

Setup should also build out-of-the-box in a Fedora environment that has all the
required packages and their dependencies installed:

  - automake
  - bison
  - flex
  - libtool
  - make
  - mingw${arch}-bzip2-static
  - mingw${arch}-gcc-c++
  - mingw${arch}-libgcrypt-static
  - mingw${arch}-libgnurx-static
  - mingw${arch}-libsolv-static (*)
  - mingw${arch}-libzstd-static (**)
  - mingw${arch}-winpthreads-static
  - mingw${arch}-xz-libs-static
  - mingw${arch}-zlib-static
  - upx (optional)

The ${arch} needs to be replaced with either "32" or "64"
depending on the target architecture to build for.

(*) Requires 'dnf copr enable jturney/mingw-libsolv'
(**) Requires 'dnf copr enable jturney/mingw-zstd'

Build commands:

0) Obtain this project's source code:
   $ git clone git://sourceware.org/git/cygwin-apps/setup.git
   $ cd setup

1) Configure using this option
   $ /path/to/setup/bootstrap.sh
   This will automatically rebuild configure files and run configure
   in the current directory.  If you have installed toolchains for
   both i686 and x86_64 architectures, then you need to select for
   which architecture you want to build:
   $ /path/to/setup/bootstrap.sh --host=i686-w64-mingw32
   $ /path/to/setup/bootstrap.sh --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32

2) $ make

3) Wondering why your binary is so much bigger than the official releases?
   This removes debugging symbols:
   $ make strip
   This additionally compresses it using UPX
   (requires package upx to be installed):
   $ make upx

CODING GUIDELINES:
------------------
setup has a number of different code formats in it. This is ok as long
as it stays readable. When submitting a patch, make sure that you use
the coding-style of the surrounding code.

For new code, use the GNU standards as much as possible.  We understand
that this is not a precise fit for C++ code but you can use Cygwin itself
as a guide.


SUBMITTING A PATCH:
-------------------
Follow the general directions given in the Cygwin contributions document:

   https://cygwin.com/contrib.html

The appropriate mailing list for this project is cygwin-apps
(rather than cygwin-patches). Thus an appropriate configuration is:

   $ git config --local format.subjectprefix "PATCH setup"
   $ git config --local sendemail.to "cygwin-apps@cygwin.com"

Before sending patches with:

   $ git format-patch [--cover-letter]
   $ git send-email *.patch
